Foundation provides the basis for creating responsive themes. Citadel extends the Foundation framework’s mixins and components to provide Stencil’s own mixins, extensible components, and utilities. The designstyle language underlying these Citadel resources is the Sass/SCSS preprocessor. Citadel resources are named according to BEM and SUIT CSS conventions. Classes are named functionally, rather than based on visual presentation or content. Citadel is based specifically on Foundation 5.5.3, which installs with the Stencil framework. We do not support Foundation 6.x, due to breaking changes introduced between versions 5.x and 6.x.\r\n\r\nCitadel design patterns reside in `cornerstone/assets/scss/components/`. Citadel assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in the following subdirectories:\r\n\r\n* `cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/citadel/`\r\n* `cornerstone/assets/scss/components/citadel/`\r\n\r\nThe `components/citadel` subdirectory contains Citadel-specific resources. The resources are named according to our style guide, which follows BEM and SUIT CSS naming conventions. Class names are structured, and hyphens are meaningful (that is, hyphens are not used merely to separate words). Here are some prototypes and examples:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  \t<th>Citadel Component Name Design Pattern</th>\r\n    <th>Class Name Example</th>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>componentName</td>\r\n    <td>.dropdown or .buttonGroup</td>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>componentName--modifierName</td>\r\n    <td>.dropdown--dropUp or .button--primary</td>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>componentName-descendantName</td>\r\n    <td>.dropdown-item</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>componentName.is-stateOfComponent</td>\r\n    <td>.dropdown.is-active.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>u-utilityName</td>\r\n    <td>.u-textTruncate</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<a id=\"theme-assets_componenets-utilities\"></a>\r\n\r\n## Components vs utilities\r\n\r\nOur naming scheme makes an architectural distinction between components and utilities. Components are defined as custom elements that enclose specific semantics, styling, and behavior. Component names are in camel case. Our syntax for naming them is as follows:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  \t<th>Component Name Design Pattern</th>\r\n    <th>Component Name Example</th>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>componentName[--modifierName|-descendantName]</td>\r\n    <td>.nav, .button</td>\r\n  <tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nUtility classes are defined as low-level, structural and positional traits. Utilities can be applied directly to any element. Multiple utilities can be used together, and utilities can be used alongside component classes.\r\n\r\nTo make HTML patterns as reusable as possible, we have used utility classes sparingly, reserving them for component-level styling.\r\n\r\nOur syntax for naming utilities is camel case, prefixed with a u- namespace:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  \t<th>Utility Name Design Pattern</th>\r\n    <th>Class Name Example</th>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>u-utilityName</td>\r\n    <td>u-navigationBar</td>\r\n  <tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<a id=\"theme-assets_variables\"></a>\r\n\r\n## Variables and mixins\r\n\r\nCitadel variables and mixins follow similar naming conventions.\r\n\r\nVariables are things that can change over time. Their names are in camel case, and show context.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  \t<th>Variable Name Design Pattern</th>\r\n    <th>Variable Name Example</th>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>[componentName[--modifierName][-descendentName]-propertyName-variablename[--modifierName]</td>\r\n    <td>-</td>\r\n  <tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n  \t<th>Mixin Name Design Pattern</th>\r\n    <th>Mixin Name Example</th>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Mixins follow regular camel-case naming conventions. Namespacing is not universally required for mixins. However, where a mixin has been created for a utility, <p>its name matches the utility’s name, including u- namespacing:</p></td>\r\n    <td>@mixin buttonVariant;\r\n@mixin u-textTruncate;</td>\r\n  <tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<a id=\"theme-assets_stencil-subdirectory\"></a>\r\n\r\n## Stencil subdirectory\r\n\r\nThe /components/stencil/ subdirectory contains CSS files unique to Stencil themes, which are used to create specific page elements within the themes. You can view this subdirectory and all its children in the Cornerstone Theme Github Repository.\r\n\r\nThis subdirectory’s children contain CSS for the following page elements.\r\n\r\n| Subdirectory  | UI Element/Purpose  |\r\n|-|-|\r\n| account  | Customer account details |\r\n| addressBox  | Customer shipping addresses |\r\n| addReturn  | Add a product-return request |\r\n| banners  | Banners displayed across storefront’s top and bottom |\r\n| blocker   | Position .blocker element above another element, to prevent a user action |\r\n| compare  | Layout for product-comparison table |\r\n| facetedSearch  | Faceted-search toggle (on/off), navigation list, and filters |\r\n| facetLabel | \tLabels for faceted-search display  |\r\n| heroCarousel  | Carousel of prominent (“hero”) images\r\n  |\r\n| navPages  | Styles for page navigation, with responsive layout |\r\n| navUser  | Styles for cart counter, quick search|\r\n| productCarousel  | Carousel of product images |\r\n| productReviews  | Styles for product reviews |\r\n| productView  | Product display (with thumbnails suppressed for mobile/tablet), product details, product options (size, color, etc.), product sharing  |\r\n| quickView | Quick-view modal window for a selected product |\r\n| ribbon  |  Top-right text badges, for messages like “On sale” |\r\n| socialLinks  | Styles for social-media links  |\r\n| tags | \tStyles for blog-post tags |\r\n| toggleLink  | Styles for collapsible/expandable components  |\r\n|writeReview   | Styles for product-review submission form  |\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Sample apps\r\n* [Cornerstone Github Repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone) (BigCommerce GitHub)\r\n\r\n### Additonal resources\r\n* [Getting Started With Foundation 5](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/) (Zurb)\r\n* [BEM](http://getbem.com/) (Get BEM)\r\n* [SUIT CSS](https://suitcss.github.io/) (GitHub)\r\n* [Customizing a Theme (Assets Directory)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUDNgprOEts) (Youtube)\r\n* [BigCommerce Sass Styling Guide](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sass-style-guide) (BigCommerce GitHub)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
