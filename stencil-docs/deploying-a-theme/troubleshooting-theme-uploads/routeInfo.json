If your file exceeds that size, please use either a WebDAV or a CDN upload to exclude large static assets.\n* Generated parsed template files must be less than 1 MB.\n\n## Error codes\n\n| Error code | Meaning |\n|:- | - |\n| TR-100, -101, -700, -1200, -1300 | A server error occurred. |\n| TR-200 | Problem uploading the theme. |\n| TR-300 | Invalid zip file. (Among other possible root causes, this can indicate an included `bundle.js.map` source-map file that exceeds its size limit of 5 MB. As a workaround, move this file outside your theme directory before re-running `stencil bundle`.) |\n| TR-301 | Failed to unzip file. |\n| TR-400 | The zip contains restricted/invalid file(s) - e.g., a file with an invalid extension. |\n| TR-500 | The zip file is larger than the 50 MB limit, or the parsed JSON for templates exceeds the 1 MB size limit. |\n| TR-600 | The zip file is missing a required file (`theme-name/templates/pages/home.html`). |\n| TR-601 | The zip file is missing some parsed template file(s); or, one or more non-`.html` files are present in the `theme-name/templates/`</nobr> subdirectory. |\n| TR-800 | There was a problem processing the contained `config.json` file. <b>Please check the `config.json` documentation for the required keys and for keys that require values. |\n| TR-900 | The contained `config.json` file is missing the required developer information. |\n| TR-901 | A theme variation defined in the contained config.json file is missing its required external ID. |\n| TR-902 | Two or more theme variations defined in the contained config.json file share a external ID. All external IDs must be unique. | \n| TR-1000 | There was a problem processing the contained <a href=\"/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/schema-json-metadata\">schema.json</a> file. |\n| TR-1001 | The theme is missing its required <a href=\"/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/schema-json-metadata\">schema.json</a> file. |\n| TR-1400 | There was a problem processing template <a href=\"/stencil-docs/front-matter/front-matter-overview\">front matter</a>. |\n| TR-1401 | There was a database validation error when saving <a href=\"/stencil-docs/front-matter/front-matter-overview\">front matter</a> to the database. |\n| TR-1500 | There was a problem uploading your files due to multi-threading (multiple simultaneous uploads). Please try again. |\n| TR-1600 | There was a temporary problem on our system. Please try again. |\n| TR-1601 | There was a problem with processing screenshots. |\n| TR-1700, -1800, -1801, -1802, -1803 | System error, possibly temporary. Please try again. |\n| TR-3402 | You are not allowed to edit your active theme. [Please select **Make a Copy**, then edit the resulting copy of your theme.] |\n| TR-4400 | One or more values in the `config.json` file exceed the 64-character limit. (The 64-character limit only applies to values in `config.json` that are both greater than 64 characters and mapped to a text input in the theme's `schema.json` file.) |\n\n## Warnings\n\nWarnings will not block a theme's upload, but these onscreen and/or log messages notify you of problems within the zipped theme. Here are the warnings and their meanings:\n\n| Warning |\n|-|\n| (These messages do not have numeric codes) |\n| Issue in processing this theme's thumbnail screenshot (`composed_image`). |\n| Issue in processing this theme's full-size screenshot (`desktop_screenshot`). |\n| Issue in processing this theme's mobile [screenshot](/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/config-json-metadata) (`mobile_screenshot`). |\n| Missing file: This theme does not support the Theme Editor, as it is missing its required `[schema.json]` file. |\n| One or more of this theme's screenshots are not image files. |\n| Theme is missing a valid thumbnail image (`composed_image`). |\n| Theme is missing a valid full-size image (`desktop_screenshot`). |\n| Theme is missing a valid mobile image (`mobile_screenshot`). |\n| One or more of this theme's images is not of a supported file type. Valid filetypes are: JPEG, PNG, GIF. |\n| Thumbnail (`composed_image`) image dimensions are not right. The expected dimensions are 600 x 760 pixels. |\n| Full-size (`desktop_screenshot`) image dimensions are not right. The expected dimensions are 2048 x 2600 pixels. |\n| Mobile (`mobile_screenshot`) image dimensions are not right. The expected dimensions are 304 x 540 pixels. |\n| Too-large image file size for a theme screenshot `composed_image` (thumbnails), `desktop_screenshot`, or `mobile_screenshot`] . The maximum supported size is x, but the file's actual size is y. |\n\n## Workarounds and further info\n* When using a Windows machine, it is necessary to close PowerShell and re-open as admin before installing nvm.\n\n* If a custom theme does not render properly after you upload and apply it to a storefront, make sure you have created the theme's zip file using the `stencil bundle` command, on a Mac OS, Linux computer, or virtual machine. Using the `stencil bundle` command will exclude Windows-specific errors that have occurred on some bundles.\n\n* If you repeatedly encounter the same error or warning and neither this page nor our KB resolves the problem, see support resources for theme developers in our [Developer Community](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/group/0F913000000HLjECAW/bigcommerce-developers).\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
