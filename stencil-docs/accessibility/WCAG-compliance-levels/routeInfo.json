You can perform similar techniques to your site regardless of your compliance level. For detailed implementation information, see [Implementing WCAG Guidelines](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/accessibility/implementing-WCAG-guidelines).\n\n## Accessibility principles\nWCAG organizes accessibility guidelines into four principles.\n\n**Perceivable.** Users can comprehend the information being presented. \nThe information cannot be invisible to all their senses.\n\n**Operable.** Users can perform actions using interface components and navigate the site.\nThe interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.\n\n**Understandable.** The information and operation of a user interface are understandable.\nThe operation of interface or information cannot cause confusion or discomfort for users.\n\n**Robust.** Users can perform a wide variety of technologies.\nThe content cannot cause content inaccessibility.\n\nWe encourage you to create content that addresses all four principles. If any principle is missing, users with disabilities will not be able to successfully use and access web content. \n\n## Accessibility guidelines\nEach principle contains guidelines, the goals you should work towards to acheive a certain conformance level. \nThe guidelines featured below are not a complete list and were chosen to highlight possible solutions for how to meet requirements. This article demonstrates how Cornerstone meets the success criteria for the following guidelines.\n \nPerceivable\n\n| Level    | Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives                                           | Cornerstone technique |\n| --       | --                                                                         | --                    | \n| Level A  | [Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content)         | Alt text is available in all areas of the theme (blogs, white pages, banners, product editor, category pages, page builder, etc.).     |\n\n| Level    | Guideline 1.3: Adaptable                                                   | Cornerstone technique |\n| --       | --                                                                         | --                    | \n| Level A  | [Meaningful Sequence](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#meaningful-sequence)   | The links in the navigation bar form a meaningful sequence.
