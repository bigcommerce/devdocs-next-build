Email invoice\r\n2. Merchant printable invoice\r\n3. Customer printable invoice\r\n4. Detailed customer printable invoice (UK orders only)\r\n\r\nMerchants commonly request developers modify the default content of invoices in order to satisfy specific business requirements and industry demands. In order to assist developers in making these changes, this articles contains instructions on how to edit each invoice.\r\n\r\n## Email invoice template\r\n\r\nSee the article [Customizing Emails](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/developing-further/customizing-emails) for editing merchant-facing email templates.\r\n\r\n## Merchant printable invoice\r\n\r\nThe merchant printable invoice is the invoice that can be printed from the control panel in **Orders** > **View**. Clicking the **...** in the **Action** column will generate a list of options, one option being **Print Invoice**.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Print Order Invoice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/customizing_invoice_print_order_invoice.png \"Order Invoice\")\r\n\r\nThe invoice that is generated by clicking **Print Invoice** relies on template files and variables from [BigCommerce's legacy Blueprint themes framework](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates). This invoice can be customized by performing the following steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Download the [invoice_printable.zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/invoice_printable.zip) file, which contains the skeleton of a printable invoice.\r\n2. Open the file in the text editor of your choice and edit the HTML file to match your desired customization.\r\n3. Use WebDAV to upload your customized HTML file to WebDAV's /template/ folder. We recommend CyberDuck, the freeware [WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#webdav-client) client, available for Windows and Mac OS. Your store's control panel offers a downloadable connection file pre-filled with most store credentials.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\r\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--\">\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n> * For a list of available variables, see [Blueprint Email Templates](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates).\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n \r\n### Localizing the merchant printable invoice\r\n\r\nLocalization of the merchant-printed invoice is handled the same way as system and error storefront messages. `PrintableInvoice.html` relies on the Blueprint template that contains currently undecorated (untranslatable) strings. The following steps describe how to translate a merchant-printed invoice.\r\n\r\n1. Download the [PrintableInvoice.html](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/invoice_printable.zip) file, which contains the skeleton of a printable invoice.\r\n2. Modify the content by replacing variables with their desired translated value.\r\n\r\n| Variable | Value |\r\n|-|-|\r\n| %%LNG_ShippingAddress%% | Shipping Address Translation |\r\n|`%%LNG_Quantity%%`| Quantity Translation|\r\n|`%%LNG_Code%%`| Code Translation |\r\n|`%%LNG_ProdName%%`| Product Name Translation |\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Upload the edited templates via [WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#webdav-client). We recommend CyberDuck, the freeware [WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#webdav-client) client, available for Windows and Mac OS. Your store's control panel offers a downloadable connection file pre-filled with most store credentials.\r\n4. Review the merchant printable invoice via the control panel.\r\n\r\n## Customizing the customer printable invoice\r\n\r\nThe customer printable invoice is the printable invoice that is available on a storefront's order page for shoppers that have registered accounts with your store.\r\n\r\n![Customer Printable Invoice](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563210752661 \"Customer Printable Invoice\")\r\n\r\nThis invoice becomes available in a shopper's orders after completing an order. A shopper can generate this invoice by clicking **Print Invoice** on the right-hand side of the page.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, you can customize this invoice by editing your theme's `invoice.html` file that is present in your theme's files. This file is located in `templates/pages/account/orders/invoice.html`.\r\n\r\n## Customizing the detailed customer printable invoice\r\n\r\nUse this invoice when a store receives an order from a shipping address in a country which supports PrintableDetailedInvoice. This invoice can be customized by performing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download the [PrintableDetailedInvoice.html](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/PrintableDetailedInvoice.html) file, which contains the skeleton of the detailed printable invoice.\r\n2. Open the file in the text editor of your choice and edit the HTML file to match your desired customization.\r\n3. Use WebDAV to upload your customized HTML file to WebDAV's /template/ folder. We recommend CyberDuck, the freeware [WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#webdav-client) client, available for Windows and Mac OS. Your store's control panel offers a downloadable connection file pre-filled with most store credentials.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Related articles\r\n* [Shrinking a Theme by Excluding Static Assets Using WebDAV](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/prepare-and-upload-a-theme/shrinking-your-theme)\r\n* [Blueprint Theme Email Templates](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates)\r\n* [Uploading and Linking to a File in Your Store](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/How-do-I-add-and-link-to-a-file-in-my-store#upload-a-file) (Knowledge Base)\r\n* [Editing and Printing Invoices](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Invoices#custom) (Knowledge Base)\r\n* [File Access (Web Dav)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV) (Knowledge Base)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
