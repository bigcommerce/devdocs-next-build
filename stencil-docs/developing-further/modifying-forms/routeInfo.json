For example:\n\n```json\n\"new_customer\": {\n        \"heading\": \"New Customer?\",\n        \"intro\": \"Create an account with us and you'll be able to:\",\n        \"fact1\": \"Get customer perks\",\n        \"fact2\": \"Place a recurring order\"\n        }\n```\n\n### Login form redirect\nBy default, customers are redirected to `/account.php` upon login, but you have the option to redirect customers to another relative URL. You can do this by passing the parameter `id=\"redirect_to\"` with a `value={path}` on a hidden form field within the `<form>` element in the template. For example:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"redirect_to\" name=\"redirect_to\" value=\"/shop-all\">\n```\nWhen the form is submitted, a `POST` request is sent to BigCommerce to validate the login information. At this point, the customer will be redirected to the page you defined.\n\nOnly relative URLs are supported for security reasons.\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
