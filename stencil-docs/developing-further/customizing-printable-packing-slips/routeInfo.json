This article contains instructions on how to edit the HTML file of a printable packing slip.\r\n\r\n## Customizing printable packing slips\r\n\r\nCustomizing your Stencil theme’s printable packing slip currently relies on a template and variables from BigCommerce’s legacy Blueprint themes framework. To make changes to the packing slip file, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Download [printable packing slip .zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/packing_slip_printable.zip), which contains the HTML skeleton of a printable packing slip.\r\n\r\n2. Make your customizations to the HTML file.\r\n\r\n3. Upload your customized HTML file to the WebDAV’s `/template/` folder [using WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV). Ensure that it is named `packing_slip_print.html` and replaces the default file, or your changes will not be applied.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Related Articles\r\n\r\n* [Checking a Theme's Size](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/deploying-a-theme/checking-a-themes-size)\r\n* [Blueprint Theme Email Templates](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates)\r\n* [File Access (WebDAV)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/File-Access-WebDAV/) (Knowledge Base)\r\n* [Uploading and Linking to a File in Your Store](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/How-do-I-add-and-link-to-a-file-in-my-store#upload-a-file) (Knowledge Base)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
