Each layout file corresponds to a specific page.\r\n\r\nFor example, `product.html` refers to the page thatâ€™s shown when a customer is viewing the details of a product.\r\n\r\nMost layout files contain nothing more than references to individual panels to be shown on a page. These panels are contained in div tags that generally define left, center, or right columns of the page.\r\n\r\n## Panels\r\n\r\nPanels provide reusable blocks or dynamic sections of content.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `SideCategoryList` panel builds a list of categories to be shown throughout the store.\r\n\r\nPanels are generally referenced directly from layout templates. They define which content should be shown on a particular page and handle the generation of that specific content.\r\n\r\nSome panels contain strictly static content (such as the store name) whilst others generate content dynamically. Dynamically generated panels cannot be created ad-hoc as they are linked to specific data and logic within the application.\r\n\r\n## Snippets\r\n\r\nSnippets are templates containing a fragment of HTML that can be embedded multiple times in a page, either from direct references or from being part of a loop that iterates over the items in a list.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `HomeFeaturedProductsItem` snippet renders each individual product listed in the `HomeFeaturedProducts` panel.\r\n\r\n## Styles\r\n\r\nPrimary layout stylesheets for the Theme, with `styles.css` being the core file.\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
