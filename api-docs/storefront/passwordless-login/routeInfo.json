This email address is where they will receive the one-time login link.\n* `redirect_url`: A link to the URL of the page where you want to redirect customers once they are logged in. This URL must be on the same domain as the store.\n<br>\nExample: \n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n\"email\": \"jane_doe@test.com\",\n\"redirect_url\": \"/checkout\"\n}\n```\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--\">\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\n    \n<!-- theme:  -->\n### Redirect URL\n> If the request body does not include a `redirect_url`, customers will be redirected as follows:\n> <br>\n> - **Failed sign-in:** Sign-in page\n> - **Successful sign-in:** User account page\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n### Response\nUpon receiving a successful `POST` request, BigCommerce will send a response that contains:\n\n* `expiry`: The time in seconds during which the login link is valid.\n* `sent_email`: A value of `sign_in` indicates BigCommerce sent the login link to the customer via the email provided. A value of `password_reset` means the customer requested a sign-in link, however BigCommerce sent a reset password email instead. BigCommerce sends the email immediately upon recieving the `POST` request.\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n\"expiry\": 900,\n\"sent_email\": \"sign_in\"\n}\n```\n\n### Email text\n\nThe customer will receive an email with the following subject line:\n\n**{Store name} - Log in to your account**\n\nThe body of the email contains the following:\n\n```html\nPlease click the link below to sign in to your account with {store name}.\n\nYou have requested a sign-in link. Please click here to sign in and continue.\n\nAlternatively, paste the following link in your browser:\nhttps://store-url/login.php?action=check_passwordless_login&token={token}&redirectUrl={redirect_URL}\n\nThis login is for {Store name} if you did not request this link, please ignore this email. Your account is still secure.\n```\nThis email uses the same email templates as other emails in your store.\n\n**Other status codes:**\n\n`429`: *Too many requests, request was rate limited*\n\n`404`: *Provided email does not belong to a customer*\n\n## Related resources\n\n### Endpoints\n* [Customer Login SSO](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/storefront/customer-login-sso)\n* [Customers V3](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/customers-v3)\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
