In this article, we'll introduce those tools and go over how to begin app development by installing and registering a draft app.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nHere's a few things you'll need before beginning app development:\r\n1. [BigCommerce sandbox store](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/getting-started/create-a-sandbox-store) (required to test app installation)\r\n2. [Developer Portal Account](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) (required to register apps)\r\n3. [BigCommerce partnership](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/) (required to publish apps to marketplace)\r\n\r\n## Beginning quickly\r\nThe fastest way to begin app development is by starting with one of our sample apps. You can follow our [Building Apps Quick Start Tutorial](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/quick-start), either alone or in conjunction with [spinning up a Heroku instance](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs) that runs our [Node / React / Next.js sample app](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs/).  \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can clone the GitHub repo for your preferred stack:\r\n\r\n* [Node / React / Next.js](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs/)\r\n* [Python / Flask](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-python-flask)\r\n* [PHP / Silex](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-php-silex)\r\n* [Ruby / Sinatra](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra)\r\n* [Laravel / React](https://github.com/bigcommerce/laravel-react-sample-app)\r\n* [Node / FaunaDB / Netlify](https://github.com/bigcommerce/channels-app/)\r\n\r\n## Testing locally with ngrok\r\nYou can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to test apps locally. It's easy to install and works well with [Express](https://expressjs.com/):\r\n\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm install express-generator -g # install express generate\r\n\r\nexpress myapp                    # generate new express app\r\n\r\ncd myapp                         # move into app dir\r\n\r\nnpm install ngrok                # install ngrok\r\n\r\nnpm install                      # install dependencies\r\n\r\nnpm start                        # start app\r\n\r\nngrok http 3000                  # start ngrok\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor step-by-step instructions, see [How to Test App Authentication Locally with ngrok](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/how-to-test-app-authentication-locally-with-ngrok-149150bfe4cf) on our [developer blog](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog).\r\n\r\n## Registering a draft app\r\nOnce you've exposed your app to the internet, you can register it as a draft app in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) using the app's callback URLs. Use the following steps to register:\r\n\r\n1. [Sign in to the Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/).\r\n2. Click **Create an App**.\r\n3. Name your app.\r\n4. Click **Technical**.\r\n5. Enter your app's callback URLs. If you're using ngrok, they'll look like this:\r\n   * **Auth**: `https://4022ffe4.ngrok.io/auth`\r\n   * **Load**: `https://4022ffe4.ngrok.io/load`\r\n   * **Uninstall**: `https://4022ffe4.ngrok.io/uninstall`\r\n6.  Click **Update & Close**.\r\n7.  Click **View Client ID** to view the app's `client_id` and `client_secret`.\r\n\r\n## Installing a draft app\r\nAny store registered to the same email as your [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) account can install your draft apps. Use the following steps to install:\r\n\r\n1. Sign in to the store and navigate to **Apps** > **My Apps** > [**My Draft Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps/drafts).\r\n2. Click the draft app thumbnail to install the draft. \r\n3. Once you click **Install**, BigCommerce will begin the OAauth flow by making a `GET` request to the app's `/auth` callback URL. If the app handles all the requests successfully, the app has been installed and you can begin feature development.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n* [Learn How Test App Authentication Locally with ngrok](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/how-to-test-app-authentication-locally-with-ngrok-149150bfe4cf)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Related articles\r\n* [Building Apps Quick Start](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/quick-start)\r\n\r\n### Sample apps\r\n* [Node / React / Next.js](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs)\r\n* [Python / Flask](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-python-flask)\r\n* [PHP / Silex](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-php-silex)\r\n* [Ruby / Sinatra](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra)\r\n* [Laravel / React](https://github.com/bigcommerce/laravel-react-sample-app)\r\n* [Node / FaunaDB / Netlify](https://github.com/bigcommerce/channels-app/)\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n* [Node API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/node-bigcommerce/)\r\n* [Python API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-python)\r\n* [PHP API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-php)\r\n* [Ruby API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-ruby)\r\n* [Ruby OmniAuth Gem](https://github.com/bigcommerce/omniauth-bigcommerce)\r\n* [Big Design Developer Playground](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/)\r\n* [Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/jTVuUkiZ1j3rux8WHG4IKK/BigDesign-UI-Kit?node-id=0%3A1/duplicate)\r\n* [Adobe Illustrator UI Kit](https://design.bigcommerce.com/bigdesign-ui-kit)\r\n\r\n### Blog posts\r\n* [How to Test App Authentication Locally with ngrok](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/how-to-test-app-authentication-locally-with-ngrok-149150bfe4cf)\r\n* [Building a BigCommerce App Using Laravel and React](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/building-a-bigcommerce-app-using-laravel-and-react-711ceceb5006)\r\n* [BigDesign Tutorial](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/bigdesign-build-native-looking-uis-with-the-bigcommerce-design-system-fb06a01a24f2)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
