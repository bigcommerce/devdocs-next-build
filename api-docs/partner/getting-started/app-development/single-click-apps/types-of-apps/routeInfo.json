The two types of apps, single-click and connector, are defined by the method of authentication. [Single-click](#single-click) apps use an OAuth Authorization Code Grant flow. [Connector apps](#connector) require store owners to manually generate and configure store API credentials. In addition to the authentication method, apps can differ by [visibility](#visibility).\n\n## Single-Click\n\nSingle-click apps are the recommended app type. They use [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) (oauth2.net) flow. Users initiate installation by clicking **Install**.\n\n![Install App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-02-types-01.png \"Install App\")\n\nThe app requests the user to grant permissions associated to scopes configured for the app in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps):\n\n![App Permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-02-types-02.png \"App Permissions\")\n\nOnce granted, the app can request a permanent `access_token` for making REST API requests on the user's behalf.\n\n## Connector\nConnector apps use manual OAuth token creation instead of the single-click app flow. Store owners generate [store API credentials](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#revoking-store-api-credentials) manually and enter them into the app's configuration. While single-click apps are recommended, the following use cases might not be compatible:\n\n- Customized integrations that vary per store.\n- Integrations that do not provide any content for an iFrame.\n- Apps that do not provide web services for OAuth exchange (ex: native order sync app).\n\n## Visibility\nThere are three visibility options for apps: **Draft**, **Unlisted**, and **Public**.\n\n| Visibility | Description | Use Cases |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Draft | Apps registered in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) but never submitted for approval | <li>Installing on stores owned by the same email address as the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/auth/bigcommerce) account email</li><li>Beta testing before publishing to the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/)</li> |\n| Unlisted | Apps submitted and approved but not listed on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) | <li>Installing on stores not owned by same email address as the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/auth/bigcommerce) account email</li><li>Beta testing before publishing to the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) |\n| Public | Apps submitted, approved, and listed on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) | <li>Making apps visible and installable on all stores</li><li>Making apps sellable on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) |\n\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--info\">\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\n\n<!-- theme: info -->\n\n### Note\n> * Only approved [partners](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/) can create unlisted apps.\n> * To have an app unlisted, contact <a href=\"mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com\">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Next steps\n[Begin app development](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/development).\n\n## Resources\n\n### Related articles\n* [Building Apps Quick Start](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/quick-start)\n\n### Sample apps\n* [Node / React / Next.js](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs)\n* [Python / Flask](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-python-flask)\n* [PHP / Silex](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-php-silex)\n* [Ruby / Sinatra](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra)\n* [Laravel / React](https://github.com/bigcommerce/laravel-react-sample-app)\n* [Node / FaunaDB / Netlify](https://github.com/bigcommerce/channels-app/)\n\n### Tools\n* [Node API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/node-bigcommerce/)\n* [Python API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-python)\n* [PHP API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-php)\n* [Ruby API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-ruby)\n* [Ruby OmniAuth Gem](https://github.com/bigcommerce/omniauth-bigcommerce)\n* [Big Design Developer Playground](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/)\n* [Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/jTVuUkiZ1j3rux8WHG4IKK/BigDesign-UI-Kit?node-id=0%3A1/duplicate)\n* [Adobe Illustrator UI Kit](https://design.bigcommerce.com/bigdesign-ui-kit)\n\n### Blog posts\n* [How to Test App Authentication Locally with ngrok](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/how-to-test-app-authentication-locally-with-ngrok-149150bfe4cf)\n* [Building a BigCommerce App Using Laravel and React](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/building-a-bigcommerce-app-using-laravel-and-react-711ceceb5006)\n* [BigDesign Tutorial](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/bigdesign-build-native-looking-uis-with-the-bigcommerce-design-system-fb06a01a24f2)\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
