Go to the [BigCommerce Pricing](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/pricing/) page and select **Start your free trial**.\n2. When prompted for an email address, enter the same email you used when applying to become a partner.\n3. In the trial store setup form, enter a store name, password, and other details. Then select **Create your store**.\n4. Log into your Partner account to access the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com). \n5. Navigate to **Support > Contact Support** and select **Create a Support Case**.\n6. Select the type of issue you have (Product Support or Billing Support).\n7. Select **Yes** to the question \"Is this related to a specific store?\"\n6. While completing the form, use \"Partner Sandbox\" as the subject line. In the case description, enter your new sandbox storeâ€™s canonical URL (for example: http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and request conversion to a sandbox. \n7. Under **Issue Type**, select **Merchant Account Services**. Click **Create Case**. We will flag this new trial store as a sandbox to ensure your store access continues beyond the 15-day trial period. This process can take several days.\n8.  Log into your new trial store using the same email associated with your partner login.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Related articles\n\n* [App Store Approval Requirements](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/app-store-approval-requirements)\n* [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/) (BigCommerce)\n* [Getting Started with the Control Panel](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Getting-Started-with-the-New-Control-Panel)\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
