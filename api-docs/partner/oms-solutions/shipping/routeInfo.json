A [shipment](/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-shipments/createordershipments) represents a grouping of order line items that you can ship to a customer. \r\n\r\nThe V2 Shipping API allows you to manage shipping zones, shipping methods, and shipping carrier connections.\r\n\r\nThe Order Shipments resource creates a shipment for an order. You can specify the shipping provider, tracking number, and shipping address ID when creating a shipment.\r\n\r\n## Checkout APIs\r\n\r\nThe [Storefront Checkout](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/storefront-checkout-api) and [Server-to-Server Checkout APIs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api) provide methods for managing a checkout up until the point when you finalized it into an order. Because you can only create shipments from finalized orders, you cannot create a shipment from Checkout API endpoints.\r\n\r\nHowever, both the Storefront and Server-to-Server Checkout APIs provide methods for creating a consignment that specifies the line items that should ship to a particular address. Creating a consignment corresponds with the actions that a shopper might take when filling out the storefront checkout page and assigning the items in their basket to their respective shipping destinations.\r\n\r\nA checkout will always have one consignment assigned to it, which is the first shipping address. A consignment supports multiple shipping addresses, with each address having its own line items.\r\n\r\n## Order shipping addresses\r\n\r\nThe [Order Shipping Addresses](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses/) endpoint allows you to view the shipping addresses on an order. An order can have more than one shipping address.\r\n\r\n## Shipping zone and shipping methods\r\n\r\nYou can configure [shipping zones](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-zones) in the control panel or use the API to designate where a merchant ships their products and with which [shipping methods](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-method) should be available in each geographic region.\r\n\r\nAn example of a shipping zone might be North America. Within that shipping zone, the shipping methods might be Free Shipping, Ship-by-Weight, and USPS.\r\n\r\n## Real-time carriers\r\n\r\nBigCommerce offers native integrations with many real-time shipping carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. The [Shipping Carrier Connection](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-carrier) resource allows you to connect an account for one of our natively supported shipping carrier integrations.\r\n\r\nFor a list of all supported carriers, see [Real-Time Quote Providers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Setting-Up-a-Real-Time-Shipping-Quote-Shipping-Method?language=en_US#providers).\r\n\r\n## Related resources\r\n\r\n### Articles\r\n* [Orders API Overview](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview)\r\n\r\n### Endpoints\r\n* [Storefront Checkouts API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/storefront-checkout-api)\r\n* [Server-to-Server Checkouts API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api)\r\n* [Order Shipping Addresses](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses/)\r\n* [Shipping v2](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
