Merchants can receive a payment for an order that was created using either the [Server to Server Checkout API Orders](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api) endpoint or the [V2 Orders](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/orders/createanorder) endpoint.\n\nProcess payments using a sequence of requests to two API hosts:\n* Create the payment token:  `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/payments/access_tokens`\n* Process the payment:  `https://payments.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/payments`\n\n### Required [OAuth Scopes](/api-docs/getting-started/authentication#authentication_oauth-scopes)\n* `Create Payments`\n* `Get Payment Methods`\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/38daa68bda00ba9d4734)\n\n## PCI compliance\n\nBigCommerce is only responsible for the security of credit cards to the extent that secure handling is maintained while the payment is en route from payment request to payment processors. As a third-party developer, you are responsible for developing the storefronts or recurring billing apps in a PCI compliant manner. You will also need to maintain a PCI compliance certification for third-party service providers certified by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).\n\nMerchants or shoppers' personal identifiable information (PII) collected by recurring billing apps that consume the BigCommerce Payments API must have its own Privacy Policy sufficient to the requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Requirements (GDPR). The GDPR must be available and displayed to the general public.\n\n\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--warning\">\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\n\n<!-- theme: warning -->\n### PCI compliance\n> If your application handles credit card data, you will need to be PCI compliant.

The card must be saved through a shopper-initiated transaction before it can be charged through the Payments API. For a list of payment gateways that support 3DS, see [All Available Payment Gateways](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Available-Payment-Gateways#all-available).\n\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--info\">\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\n\n<!-- theme:  -->\n### Hosted providers\n> The API flow does not currently support hosted/offsite providers, such as PayPal, and wallet type payments, such as Amazon Pay.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Stored cards\nThere are three steps to using a stored card to make a payment.\n\n1. [Get Payment Methods](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-methods/paymentsmethodsget)\n2. [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost)\n3. [Process Payment](/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments/payment/paymentspost)\n\nTo use stored cards with the Payments API or the Checkout SDK, make sure you enable stored cards in the store's control panel. To enable stored credit cards on your storefront, navigate to **Store Setup › Payments**, and click the tab for your payment gateway. Toggle the switch to enable Stored Credit Cards and click **Save**. For more on enabling stored cards, see [Enabling Stored Credit Cards](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Enabling-Stored-Credit-Cards).\n\n**Requirements for stored cards**\n\n* Your store must be on a Plus plan or higher.\n* Your store needs to be using Optimized One-Page Checkout.\n* Your store needs to be using a compatible payment gateway.\n\n1. Make a call to [Get Payment Methods](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-methods/paymentsmethodsget) for the `stored_instruments > token` to pay with a stored card. The `order_id` passes in as a query parameter.\n\nThis token is the same as `payment_instrument_token` from [Get Transactions](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-transactions-api).\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\ntitle: \"Sample Response\"\nsubtitle: \"Get Payment Methods\"\nlineNumbers: true\n-->\n\n**Example response get payment methods**\n`/GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/payments/methods?order_id={{order_id}}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"stripe.card\",\n      \"name\": \"Stripe\",\n      \"test_mode\": true,\n      \"type\": \"card\",\n      \"supported_instruments\": [\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"VISA\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"MASTERCARD\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"AMEX\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"DISCOVER\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"JCB\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"DINERS_CLUB\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"instrument_type\": \"STORED_CARD\",\n          \"verification_value_required\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"stored_instruments\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"stored_card\",\n          \"brand\": \"VISA\",\n          \"expiry_month\": 9,\n          \"expiry_year\": 2020,\n          \"issuer_identification_number\": \"424242\",\n          \"last_4\": \"4242\",\n          \"token\": \"050a1e5c982e5905288ec5ec33f292772762033a070a45g434qfb16bf1940b51ef\",\n          \"is_default\": true\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"meta\": {}\n}\n```\n\nMake a note of the `token` to use as part of processing the payment in the request body.\n\n### Create access token\n2. Make a request to [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost) to get the authorization token that needs to be passed in the header when processing the payment. The ID of the order needs to be part of the request body.\n\n<!--\ntitle: \"Sample Request\"\nsubtitle: \"Create Payment Access Token\"\nlineNumbers: true\n-->\n\n**Example request create payment access token**\n`/POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/payments/access_tokens`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"order\": {\n    \"id\": 215\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--\ntitle: \"Sample Response\"\nsubtitle: \"Create Payment Access Token\"\nlineNumbers: true\n-->\n\n**Example response create payment access token**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1NTEzOTQxNDIsIm5iZiI6MTU1MTM5MDU0MiwiaXNzIjoicGF5bWVudHMuYmlnY29tbWVyY2UuY29tIiwic3ViIjoianJhaDZnbW4iLCJqdGkiOiI3Nzg3ZmU1Zi01OWJmLTQ3ZWMtYTFmZC00ZDQ3ZTkwNjFlNWMiLCJpYXd4gJ8uHDk3kDhhuyefsrtr45mRhdGEiOnsic3RvcmVfaWQiOjEwMjU2NDYsIm9yZGVyX2lkIjoyMTUsImFtb3VudCI6OTgwMCwiY3VycmVuY3kiOiJVU0QifX0.WbR90d8m4gn8wK7kPMDEoVq8B0hHC5Ul5H4Hpqq6Yvo\"\n  },\n  \"meta\": {}\n}\n```\n\n### Process the payment\n3.

When creating the order using the Orders API make sure the `status_id:0`. If you do not create an order with order status set to `0` or `Incomplete`, the Payments API will return an [error](#error-codes).\nEnsure customers enter their billing address and line items when creating the order. The customer can create the order as a guest order by either setting the\n`customer_id:0`or leaving it blank. After the order is created, then follow the steps for either a [credit card](#payments_credit-cards) or a [stored card](#payments_stored-cards).\n\n<!--\ntitle: \"Example Create Order\"\nsubtitle: \"\"\nlineNumbers: true\n-->\n\n**Example create an order**\n`/POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v2/orders`\n\n```json\n{\n    \"status_id\": 0,\n    \"customer_id\": 11,\n    \"billing_address\": {\n        \"first_name\": \"Jane\",\n        \"last_name\": \"Does\",\n        \"company\": \"\",\n        \"street_1\": \"123 Main Street\",\n        \"street_2\": \"\",\n        \"city\": \"Austin\",\n        \"state\": \"Texas\",\n        \"zip\": \"78751\",\n        \"country\": \"United States\",\n        \"country_iso2\": \"US\",\n        \"email\": \"janedoe@email.com\"\n    },\n    \"shipping_addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"first_name\": \"Trishy\",\n            \"last_name\": \"Test\",\n            \"company\": \"Acme Pty Ltd\",\n            \"street_1\": \"666 Sussex St\",\n            \"street_2\": \"\",\n            \"city\": \"Anywhere\",\n            \"state\": \"Some State\",\n            \"zip\": \"12345\",\n            \"country\": \"United States\",\n            \"country_iso2\": \"US\",\n            \"phone\": \"\",\n            \"email\": \"janedoe@email.com\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"products\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"BigCommerce Poster\",\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"price_inc_tax\": 10.98,\n            \"price_ex_tax\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"BigCommerce Poster II\",\n            \"quantity\": 1,\n            \"price_inc_tax\": 50,\n            \"price_ex_tax\": 45\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Technical details\n\n### Using test credit cards\n\nThe following is a list of supported gateways and a list of their test credit cards. These can be useful while getting your app setup. Check your credit card setup in both [BigCommerce](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Online-Payment-Methods#setup) and the payment gateway to make sure they are configured properly. If the credit cards do not work or stop working, please reach out to the payment provider as these are not maintained by BigCommerce.\n\n* [Authorize.Net](https://developer.authorize.net/hello_world/testing_guide/)\n* [PayPal Powered by Braintree](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/credit-cards/testing-go-live/php)\n* [CyberSource](https://www.cybersource.com/developers/other_resources/quick_references/test_cc_numbers/)\n* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards)\n\n### Token\nThe `payment_access_token` is not from the payment provider. It is created by BigCommerce.\n\n### Decline payments\nA declined payment will return a 4XX error with details if available.\n\n### Authorization\nIf you configure a payment gateway for authorization only, authorization happens at the time of processing. You will need to capture the order later using the control panel or the Capture API. If you configure a payment gateway for authorization and capture, the payment will be authorized and captured at the time of processing.\n\n### Control panel\nOrders created and captured via the API will look the same as other orders created via the storefront or other apps.

Payments are processed through BigCommerce.\n\n**Can I issue a refund?**\n\nYou can issue a refund using the [control panel](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Processing-Refunds), the Refunds API, or through the payment gateway directly.\n\n**How do I process payment for a capture credit card?**\n\nOnce you have an authorized payment, perform the capture step using the [control panel](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/How-can-I-set-my-payment-gateway-to-only-authorize-transactions-and-not-capture-the-funds-automatically) or the Capture API.\n\n**Can I use this on orders with more than one shipping address?**\nYes, checkouts and orders with more than one consignment can use the Payments API.\n\n**Is store credit supported?**\n\nStore credit is not a supported payment method with the Payments API. Store credit can still be used by the shopper on the storefront, part of the control panel, or with the Checkout API.\n\n**Are gift certificates supported?**\n\nThe Payment Processing API is for processing payments through a store's payment gateway. Since BigCommerce store gift cards are not processed through a payment gateway, they can not be processed through the Payment Processing API.\n\n**Are offline payment methods supported?**\nThe Payments API processes credit card payments through supported payment gateways; it does not expose methods for processing [offline payment methods](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Offline-Payment-Methods) such as cash on delivery.\n\n**Is Strong Customer Authentication supported?**\n\nPayment gateways that use 3D Secure meet the EU's Strong Customer Authentication regulation requirements. To see which BigCommerce supported payment gateways use 3D Secure, refer to the Help Center's [Available Payment Gateways](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Available-Payment-Gateways#all-available) page.\n\n## Related resources\n\n### Articles\n* [Available Payment Gateways](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Available-Payment-Gateways)\n* [Enabling Stored Credit Cards](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Enabling-Stored-Credit-Cards)\n* [Manually Capturing Transactions (Authorize Only)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/How-can-I-set-my-payment-gateway-to-only-authorize-transactions-and-not-capture-the-funds-automatically)\n* [Processing Refunds](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Processing-Refunds)\n\n\n### Endpoints\n* [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost)\n* [Get Payment Methods](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-methods/paymentsmethodsget)\n* [Process Payment](/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments/payment/paymentspost)\n\n### Webhooks\n- [Cart](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/webhook-events#webhook-events_cart)\n- [Customer Payment Instrument](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/webhook-events#webhook-events_customer)\n- [Orders](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/webhook-events#webhook-events_orders)\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
