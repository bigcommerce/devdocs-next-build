Once approved, apps can be sold (or made available free of charge) to all BigCommerce merchants on the [Apps Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps). This is the first article in a comprehensive developer's guide to building BigCommerce apps. It provides a brief, high-level introduction for developers new to the platform. If you already have experience developing for BigCommerce, feel free to [skip ahead](#next-steps) or check out the [quick start tutorial](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/quick-start).\r\n\r\n\r\n## About BigCommerce apps\r\n\r\nLet's first take a look how apps are discovered, displayed, and managed on BigCommerce stores.\r\n\r\n### Discovery\r\nApproved apps are listed on the app [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) for merchants to browse, search, and install.\r\n\r\n![App Marketplace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-01-introduction-01.png \"App Marketplace\")\r\n\r\n### Management\r\nApps installed on a store are managed in the store's control panel under **Apps** > [**My Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps/drafts). Here, store users can launch or uninstall the app.\r\n\r\n![App Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-01-introduction-02.png  \"App Management\")\r\n\r\n### Display\r\nWhen a merchant launches an app, BigCommerce makes a request to the app's `/load` callback and displays the app's UI in an iFrame.\r\n\r\n![App Display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-01-introduction-03.png  \"App Display\")\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\nWhat can developers do with BigCommerce apps?\r\n\r\n### Integrate with business systems\r\nUse [BigCommerce APIs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference) to integrate stores with business systems such as the following:\r\n* [ERP systems](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/erp/)\r\n* [Order management platforms](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/catalog-order-management/)\r\n* [Accounting software](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/accounting-tax/)\r\n* [Shipping and Fulfillment services](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipping-fulfillment/)\r\n\r\n[Learn more about BigCommerce's APIs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Connect to sales channels\r\nList products on external [sales channels](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/sales-channels/) with [Channels Toolkit](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/channels-toolkit-reference).\r\n\r\n[Learn more about connecting apps to sales channels.](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/overview).\r\n\r\n### Add and manage scripts\r\nCreate and manage scripts with [Scripts API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/scripts) and [Script Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Using-Script-Manager).\r\n\r\n[Learn more about creating scripts](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefront/scripts-overview).\r\n\r\n### Create custom widgets\r\nCreate [widgets](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Page-Builder#builder) for merchants to install and configure.\r\n\r\n[Learn more about creating widgets](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefront/widgets/widgets-overview).\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nHere's how to get started with BigCommerce development:\r\n1.
