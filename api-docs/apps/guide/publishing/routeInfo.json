This article takes you step-by-step through the submission form and provides descriptions for each field.\r\n\r\n## Before you begin\r\n\r\nYour listing on the [Apps Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) plays a major role in your app's success. A good listing accomplishes three goals:\r\n*  Shows users how your platform or solution differs from competitive offerings\r\n* Includes keywords so prospective users can find your listing in searches\r\n* Sets up clear and accurate user expectations as to your solution's features and functionality\r\n\r\nBefore you begin completing the app registration, we recommend prepping the following assets:\r\n* Company logos\r\n* Screenshots and video content\r\n* Case studies\r\n\r\nWe also recommend giving special attention to the following search indexed fields:\r\n* App name\r\n* App summary\r\n* App category\r\n\r\n## Provide a summary\r\n\r\nTo begin the app certification process, we'll need some basic information about you.\r\n\r\n![DevTools 01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/devtools-tutorial-01.png  \"DevTools 01\")\r\n\r\n| Field           | Description                                                                                            |\r\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| Contact Name    | Email address created when applying for your Partner ID                                                |\r\n| Partner Name    | Name of your companyâ€‹; attributed on the detail page                                                    |\r\n| Partner Website | URL to your homepage                                                                                   |\r\n| Support Email   | Business mail where users can get help with the app                                                    |\r\n| Support Website | Used for **Get Support** button in Marketplace                                                         |\r\n| Partner ID      | Required for submission; assigned to [partners](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/becoming-a-partner#applying-to-the-technology-partner-program) after approval |\r\n| App Name        | Brand name given to app for titles and app content; should not include taglines or descriptors         |\r\n| App Logo        | Primary app logo; should be 350 x 130px with a white background and dark branding with no taglines     |\r\n| App Icon        | Shown on main app detail page and left nav in control panel once installed; should be 200 x 200px      |\r\n| Price           | App's starting price; if offering free plan, choose **Free**; specify details in **Other** selection   |\r\n| App Summary     | App tagline used in the marketplace category and search results; 128 character max                     |\r\n| Category        | Marketplace category for app; used as search attribute; BigCommerce may re-categorize prior to launch  |\r\n\r\n## Add technical information\r\n\r\nSpecify app type, multiple users support, callback URLs, and OAuth scopes; and, provide detailed testing instructions.\r\n\r\n![DevTools 02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/devtools-tutorial-02.png  \"DevTools 02\")\r\n\r\n| Field                  | Description                                                                |\r\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Multiple Users         | Optionally allow your app to be accessible to store users other than owner |\r\n| App Type               | Type of app; single-Click recommended                                      |\r\n| Auth Callback URL      | Requested when `install` clicked                                           |\r\n| Load Callback URL      | Requested when user launches app                                           |\r\n| Uninstall Callback URL | Requested when store owner clicks uninstall                                |\r\n| OAuth Scopes           | OAuth scopes the app requires                                              |\r\n| Test Instructions      | Instructions needed to test the app thoroughly                             |\r\n\r\n## Fill in details\r\n\r\nProvide a helpful description with screenshots and a video to promote your app. We recommend bullet points followed by short paragraphs with headers.

These will be reviewed as part of the Marketplace approval process. The **Case Studies** field and **Videos** field are optional.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Am I able to preview the changes to my listing before publishing them?**\r\n\r\nYes! With the updated fields in the Developer Portal, we're also adding the ability to\r\npreview how these changes will appear on the BigCommerce Marketplace. You will see the option to preview on a new step after Review when editing your listing.\r\n\r\n**Is there a draft status for these changes, or will saving make them live?**\r\n\r\nAny changes you save will take effect immediately, so make sure you're ready to push them out to the Marketplace before saving.\r\n\r\n**I've logged in to the Developer Portal, but I don't see my published listing. Where is it?**\r\n\r\nYou may have logged in with the wrong account. Each listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely assigned to another email address. If you're unable to track down the correct owner account for your solution, please reach out to [appstore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).\r\n\r\n**I saved my changes, but my listing has not updated yet. What's the problem?**\r\n\r\nThe changes will be effective immediately in your control panel app card, but the updates\r\ncan take up to 24 hours to appear on the Apps Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to make edits as needed.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n[Review the Apps Marketplace listing guide (PDF)](https://grow.bigcommerce.com/rs/695-JJT-333/images/Updated_List_of_App_Fields_for_Tech_Partners.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Sample apps\r\n* [Node / React / Next.js](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs)\r\n* [Python / Flask](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-python-flask)\r\n* [PHP / Silex](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-php-silex)\r\n* [Ruby / Sinatra](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra)\r\n* [Laravel / React](https://github.com/bigcommerce/laravel-react-sample-app)\r\n* [Node / FaunaDB / Netlify](https://github.com/bigcommerce/channels-app/)\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n* [Node API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/node-bigcommerce/)\r\n* [Python API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-python)\r\n* [PHP API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-php)\r\n* [Ruby API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-ruby)\r\n* [Ruby OmniAuth Gem](https://github.com/bigcommerce/omniauth-bigcommerce)\r\n* [Big Design Developer Playground](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/)\r\n* [Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/jTVuUkiZ1j3rux8WHG4IKK/BigDesign-UI-Kit?node-id=0%3A1/duplicate)\r\n* [Adobe Illustrator UI Kit](https://design.bigcommerce.com/bigdesign-ui-kit)\r\n\r\n### Blog posts\r\n* [How to Test App Authentication Locally with ngrok](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/how-to-test-app-authentication-locally-with-ngrok-149150bfe4cf)\r\n* [Building a BigCommerce App Using Laravel and React](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/building-a-bigcommerce-app-using-laravel-and-react-711ceceb5006)\r\n* [BigDesign Tutorial](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/bigdesign-build-native-looking-uis-with-the-bigcommerce-design-system-fb06a01a24f2)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
