Verify your app meets the requirements below before submitting it for approval.\r\n\r\n## General requirements\r\n\r\n- Make support resources available throughout the app, like during onboarding and on the app's dashboard within the BigCommerce iframe.\r\n- Follow branding guidelines when referencing BigCommerce (see our [Media Kit](https://www.bigcommerce.com/press/media-kit/) for more information).\r\nDon't reference competitor platforms in the app's listing information or dashboard.\r\n* Use the same app name in app submission and in app content such as logos and descriptions.\r\n* Keep app titles concise. Avoid using extra taglines or descriptors; include those in the app summary, if necessary.\r\n* Include the name of both your brand and any connected third-party platforms in the title (ex:\r\n\"Marketplace by BigCommerce\" or \"Search by BigCommerce\").\r\n- Develop app client-side code to be compatible with all BigCommerce [supported browsers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Themes-Supported-Browsers) and default features.\r\n- Include applicable test account details in your test instructions with the submission for any third-party services required in the app.\r\n- Use BigCommerce APIs for app functionality wherever possible. For example, don't require a merchant to manually import a product CSV if those products can be retrieved using the BigCommerce API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Listing\r\n\r\n* Approval for the [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) requires all fields listed in the Publishing Apps section (**Case Studies** and **Videos** are optional).\r\n* Listings should be well worded, cleanly formatted, and follow wording and image specifications.\r\n* App listing name should be restricted to only branding and not include taglines.\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\n* Apps must work as intended and cannot conflict with BigCommerce functionality.\r\n* Apps must use V3 endpoints in favor of V2 endpoints when feature parity exists.\r\n* Apps must serve all callback URLs over HTTPS.\r\n* Apps in the Marketplace must be[ multi-user enabled](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/users).\r\n* Apps that process transactions or handle credit card data must pass a PCI Compliance review by BigCommerce's security team. New payment gateway app submissions may not be accepted for Marketplace review.\r\n* Apps that access the Checkout Content scope will also be subject to a security assessment by BigCommerce's security team.\r\n* Apps that modify the checkout experience must use the BigCommerce [Checkout SDK](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/checkout-sdk).\r\n* Apps that add another marketplace or sales channel to a store should make use of the [Channels Toolkit](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/guide/building-channel-apps) and follow [Channel App Requirements](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/guide/channel-app-requirements).\r\n* Apps that create orders in the BigCommerce store need to properly mark accurate order source, payment method, and other order details.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* Apps should be [single-click](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/types#single-click) and use [OAuth flow](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/auth) to authenticate.\r\n* Apps must respond to install [callback](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/callbacks) with styled and branded HTML for the control panel iframe; this content cannot be blank and must follow our user-interface constraints. Apps using [BigDesign](https://design.bigcommerce.com/components) are preferred.\r\n* Apps must store user tokens against the store hash, not the user's email address, to avoid problems with ownership changes and multiple user support.\r\n* Apps need to include options for new user registration as well as existing users.\r\n* Apps should autofill registration fields such as email address and store URL based on the store's information.\r\n* Apps should include onboarding instructions and any setup requirements after installing.\r\n* Apps that install scripts must use the [Scripts API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/scripts) to insert into Script Manager using proper `consent_category`.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\r\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--info\">\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n> 1.

These will be reviewed as part of the Marketplace approval process. **Case Studies** and **Videos** are optional.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n* [Publish your app](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/publishing).\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Sample apps\r\n\r\n* [Node / React / Next.js](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs)\r\n* [Python / Flask](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-python-flask)\r\n* [PHP / Silex](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-php-silex)\r\n* [Ruby / Sinatra](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra)\r\n* [Laravel / React](https://github.com/bigcommerce/laravel-react-sample-app)\r\n* [Node / FaunaDB / Netlify](https://github.com/bigcommerce/channels-app/)\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n* [Node API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/node-bigcommerce/)\r\n* [Python API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-python)\r\n* [PHP API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-php)\r\n* [Ruby API Client](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-ruby)\r\n* [Ruby OmniAuth Gem](https://github.com/bigcommerce/omniauth-bigcommerce)\r\n* [BigDesign Developer Playground](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/)\r\n* [Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/jTVuUkiZ1j3rux8WHG4IKK/BigDesign-UI-Kit?node-id=0%3A1/duplicate)\r\n* [Adobe Illustrator UI Kit](https://design.bigcommerce.com/bigdesign-ui-kit)\r\n\r\n### Blog posts\r\n\r\n* [How to Test App Authentication Locally with ngrok](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/how-to-test-app-authentication-locally-with-ngrok-149150bfe4cf)\r\n* [Building a BigCommerce App Using Laravel and React](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/building-a-bigcommerce-app-using-laravel-and-react-711ceceb5006)\r\n* [BigDesign Tutorial](https://medium.com/bigcommerce-developer-blog/bigdesign-build-native-looking-uis-with-the-bigcommerce-design-system-fb06a01a24f2)\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
