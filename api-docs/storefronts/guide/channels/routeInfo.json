A **channel** is essentially a sales platform such as a headless storefront, a marketplace, or a POS system. A **site** is a domain that links a headless storefront to a sales channel.\n\nYou can create both using the [Channels API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/channels).\n\n1. Start by sending a `POST` request to the `/channels` endpoint to create a channel for your headless platform. Retrieve the channel ID returned in the response. You will use it to create a channel site and authenticate cross-origin requests.\n2. Pass that channel ID in a `POST` request to `/channels/{channel_id}/site` to create a site for the provided channel.\n3. After setting up the channel, you can authenticate cross-origin requests by [creating a JWT token](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/tokens/api-token/createtoken) through the GraphQL Storefront API. Make sure to create your GraphQL Storefront API token with the same channel ID as your headless platform; otherwise, your request will be rejected.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Learn how to work with products](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefronts/guide/products)\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Building Storefront Channels](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/tutorials/storefront)"}],"children":[]}}}}
