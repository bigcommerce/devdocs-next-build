We also offer themes with powerful design tools and features that let you build and host your storefront on our servers.\n\n### Headless BigCommerce\n\nBigCommerce's flexibility allows for headless architecture, the ability to integrate storefront frontends with the BigCommerce backend. Some of the headless setups have the advantage of providing the following:\n\n- Customize your frontend technologies without migrating your database\n- Preserve your legacy frontend while switching to BigCommerce as your ecommerce engine\n- Power multiple stores on multiple sales channels from a single BigCommerce dashboard.\n\n### Next.js Commerce\n\nNext.js Commerce is a headless integration to BigCommerce. Created in partnership with the Next.js and Vercel teams, Next.js Commerce showcases how powerful Next.js is when partnered with our open SaaS ecommerce platform.\n\nView the [demo application](https://demo.vercel.store/) to get an idea of the robust set of features that Next.js Commerce offers.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started with Next.js Commerce, you'll need to deploy a live version directly from Vercel. Then, you can develop locally by cloning the new Git repository created during deployment. The following steps will walk you through the process.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- An IDE\n- Knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n- Knowledge of [BigCommerce APIs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs)\n- Git provider (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab)\n- NPM\n\n### Deploying Next.js Commerce directly from Vercel\n\n1. Visit [nextjs.org/commerce](https://nextjs.org/commerce) and click **Clone and Deploy**.\n\n   ![Clone and Deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-01.png)\n\n2. When prompted, create a Vercel account by logging in using one of the supported Git providers. The Git provider you choose is where Vercel will clone the Next.js Commerce repository.\n\n   **Note:** If you have an existing Vercel account, you can sign in using those credentials.\n\n   ![Create Vercel account](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/nextjs_commerce/commerce_get_started.png)\n\n3. After signing in, a **Create Git Repository** dialogue will appear with a dropdown to select your Git Scope, and a **Repository Name** text field. You may change the name of the project from the default or leave it as-is. Click **Create** to proceed.\n\n   ![Create Git repository](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/nextjs_commerce/commerce_create_repo.png)\n\n4. (Optional) Create a team. You can also click **Skip** to continue without creating a Vercel Team.\n\n   ![Create Vercel team](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/nextjs_commerce/commerce_create_team.png)\n\n5. In the **Add Integrations** dialogue box, click **Add** to connect your BigCommerce store to your Vercel project.\n\n   ![Add BigCommerce integration](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/nextjs_commerce/commerce_add_integrations.png)\n\n6. In the **Add BigCommerce to Your Vercel Project** dialogue, select **Sign Up** or **Log In**.\n\n   1. If you are an existing developer on BigCommerce, select **Log In** and use your BigCommerce credentials to integrate BigCommerce and Vercel. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the Vercel app to your BigCommerce store.\n\n      ![Existing BigCommerce store log in button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-06.png)\n\n      ![Log in to existing BigCommerce store dialogue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-07.png)\n\n   2. If you are new to BigCommerce, select **Sign Up** to create a BigCommerce developer sandbox store and populate it with sample data. Vercel will connect Next.js Commerce to this sandbox store automatically. If you would later like to upgrade your sandbox store to a live store, contact BigCommerce by calling [1-888-248-9325](tel:1-888-248-9325).\n\n      ![Sign up for BigCommerce store button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-08.png)\n\n      ![Sign up for BigCommerce store registration form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-09.png)\n\n7. Upon completion of deployment to Vercel, you will see your site deployed in a thumbnail image.\n\n![Commerce deployment confirmation dialogue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-14.png)\n\n### Developing locally after Vercel deployment\n\n1. Visit the Git provider where Vercel created a new repository. Clone that repository locally.\n2. Navigate to the locally cloned project's root directory and create a copy of the `.env.template` file. Rename the newly created file `.env.local` and insert the your environmental variables using the following as a reference:\n\n```bash\nBIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=https://store-${STORE_ID}.mybigcommerce.com/graphql\nBIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=${STOREFRONT_TOKEN}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/${STORE_ID}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=${STORE_TOKEN}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=${STORE_CLIENT}\n```\n\n```bash\nCOMMERCE_PROVIDER=bigcommerce\nBIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=https://store-${STORE_HASH}-${CHANNEL_ID}.mybigcommerce.com/graphql\nBIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=${STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/${STORE_ID}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=${STORE_TOKEN}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=${STORE_CLIENT}\nBIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=${CHANNEL_ID}\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_URL=https://store-${STORE_HASH}.mybigcommerce.com\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_STORE_HASH=${STORE_HASH}\n```\n\n- `STORE_HASH`: You can retrieve it from your BigCommerce store control panel URL in the format of `https://store-${STORE_HASH}.mybigcommerce.com/manage/dashboard`\n\n  ![STORE-HASH location in URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-15.png)\n\n- `STORE_TOKEN|STORE_CLIENT`: For instructions on generating Store API credentials, visit [Obtaining Store API Credentials](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#obtaining-store-api-credentials).\n- `STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`: For instructions on generating the Storefront API token, visit [Create a Token](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/tokens/api-token/createtoken).\n- `CHANNEL_ID`: Use the channel ID of the channel created by Vercel during deployment. For information on how to retrieve channel information, visit [Get All Channels](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/channels/channels/listchannels).\n\n3. Open a terminal in your repository's root directory. To install the project's dependencies, run `npm install`.\n\n4. When dependencies have finished installing, run `npm run dev` in your terminal. Next.js will load the environmental variables from `.env.local`, start a local server, and compile your project.\n\n5. To see your Next.js Commerce storefront running locally, open `localhost:3000` in your browser.\n\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--info\">\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\n\n> ### Note\n>\n> Any saved changes you push to your Git repository will trigger a redeployment at Vercel. You can also trigger a redeployment manually through the Vercel dashboard.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Application\n\nThe architecture for Next.js Commerce is standard for a Next.js application. To learn Next.js basics, visit [the official Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).\n\nTo understand how Commerce generates pages and updates product information on your storefront, we will further explore a couple of concepts.\n\n### Pre-rendering pages\n\nOne of the main advantages of Next.js is the fast page load times you can achieve by pre-rendering your content. By default, Next.js pre-renders all pages.\n\nNext.js allows you to choose how pages are pre-rendered:\n\n- **Static Generation:** Next.js generates the HTML at build time and reuses on each request.\n- **Server-side Rendering:** Next.js generates the HTML on each request.\n\nNext.js Commerce statically generates pages while still keeping store information updated by using Incremental Static Regeneration.\n\n**Static Page Generation**\n\nNext.js pre-renders static content by calling the `getStaticProps()` function at build time on the server-side. Since `getStaticProps()` does not run on the client-side, you can do direct database queries or run other functions without exposing them to the client. To verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, use Vercel's [Code Elimination](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/) tool.\n\n**Incremental Static Regeneration**\n\nWith `getStaticProps()`, you may still use dynamic content on your statically generated pages. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) updates existing pages by re-rendering them in the background when triggered by site traffic after a set timeout period. By default, data revalidation runs at most once every four hours, though you may customize this frequency.\n\nFor more information and a demonstration on how ISR works, visit Vercel's [Static Reactions Demo](https://reactions-demo.vercel.app/).\n\nBy default, Next.js Commerce revalidates and updates product information from BigCommerce at most once every four hours.\n\n### Fetching and populating store data\n\nNext.js Commerce uses [Storefront-data-hooks](https://github.com/bigcommerce/storefront-data-hooks) to connect your Next.js frontend with the BigCommerce backend. The package contains code-split React hooks for data fetching using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) (stale-while-revalidate). SWR is a layer on top of React Hooks that automates cache management. Data can be transitively stale, but SWR will always re-fetch and synchronize the correct data from BigCommerce.\n\nStorefront Data Hooks has helper functions to handle common user actions such as login, logout, and register.\n\nSWR uses FETCH for data fetching: [vercel/fetch: Opinionated fetch (with retrying and DNS caching) optimized for use inside microservices](https://github.com/vercel/fetch).\n\n## Application settings\n\n### Next SEO\n\nNext.js Commerce includes the [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) plugin to simplify SEO settings so that Next.js Commerce appears correctly in search results and is more readily shareable on social media. To learn how to configure Next SEO settings, visit the [Next SEO GitHub repository](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo).\n\n### Component styling\n\nNext.js Commerce uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style components. Next.js Commerce's root directory contains a `tailwind.config.js` file where you can customize much of the project's styling. For more information on how to configure the `tailwind.config.js` file, visit [Tailwind CSS - Configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).\n\n### Internationalized routing\n\nNext.js supports internationalized (i18n) routing and Next.js Commerce uses [sub-path routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing#sub-path-routing) which puts the locale in the URL path. By default, the `next.config.js` file has US English (`en-US`) and Spanish (`es`) set as locales with `en-US` set as the default.\n\n```json\ni18n: {\nlocales: ['en-US', 'es'],\ndefaultLocale: 'en-US',\n},\n```\n\nFor more information on i18n routing in Next.js, see the Next.js documentation on [internationalized routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing).\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Next.js Commerce](http://nextjs.org/commerce)\n- [Next.js Commerce Framework](https://github.com/vercel/commerce-framework)\n- [BigCommerce Storefront Data Hooks](https://github.com/bigcommerce/storefront-data-hooks)\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
