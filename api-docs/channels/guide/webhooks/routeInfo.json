To facilitate this, we've added `store/channel` webook events that fire when a channel is created or updated. We'll assume you're faimilar with webhooks and briefly introduce the channel event in this article; however, if you would like an introduction to webhooks, see [Webhooks Overview](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/about-webhooks).\n\n## Channel webhook events\n\n| Name                  | Description |\n|-----------------------|-------------|\n| `store/channel/* `      | Subscribe to all store/channel events|\n| `store/channel/created` | Fires when a channel is created via control panel or API |\n| `store/channel/updated` | Fires when a channel is updated via control panel or API |\n\nUpdates to the following fields trigger a `store/channel/updated` event.\n\n* `name`\n* `external_id`\n* `status`\n* `is_listable_from_ui`\n* `is_visible`\n* `is_enabled` (to be deprecated)\n* `config_meta`\n\n\n## Channel webhook callbacks\n\nBelow is an example of a callback BigCommerce will send to the `destination` URL when a channel event fires.\n\n```json\n{\n \"store_id\":11111,\n \"producer\":\"stores/abcde\",\n \"scope\":\"store/channel/created\",\n \"data\":{\n         \"type\":\"channel\",\n         \"id\":173331\n        },\n \"hash\":\"3f9ea420af83450d7ef9f78b08c8af25b2213637\"\n }\n ```\n\n | Property | Description |\n|-|-|\n|`type`| Will always be channel |\n|`id`  | The ID of the channel  |\n\n## Creating a channel webhook\n\nTo create a webhook that subscribe to channel events, send a `POST` request to [/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/hooks](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/webhooks/webhooks/createwebhooks) with `scope` set to a `store/channel/created`, `store/channel/updated`, or `store/channel/*`.\n\n\n```http\nPOST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/hooks\nX-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}\nContent-Type: application/json\nAccept: application/json\n\n{\n  \"scope\": \"store/order/updated\",\n  \"destination\": \"https://yourapp.example.com/webhooks\", # custom ports not supported\n  \"is_active\": true\n}\n```\n\n[![Open in Request Runner](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/Open-Request-Runner.svg)](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/webhooks/webhooks/createwebhooks#requestrunner)\n\n[Learn more about creating webhooks](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/setting-up-webhooks).\n\n## Resources\n\n### Related articles\n\n* [Webhooks Overview](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/setting-up-webhooks)\n* [Webhooks Tutorial](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/setting-up-webhooks)\n* [Webhooks Events](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/webhook-events)"}],"children":[]}}}}
