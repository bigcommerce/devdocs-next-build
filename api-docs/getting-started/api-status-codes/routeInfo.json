Error responses might also include an error message in the body to assist in resolving the problem.\r\n\r\n## 2xx Success \r\n\r\n2xx codes are returned for requests that were understood and processed successfully.\r\n\r\n| Code | Text | Purpose |\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n| **200** | **OK** | For successful `GET` and `PUT` requests. |\r\n| **201** | **Created** | For a successful `POST` request. |\r\n| **202** | **Accepted** | For a request that resulted in a scheduled task being created to perform the actual request. |\r\n| **204** | **No Content** | For a successful request that produced no response (such as `DELETE` requests). |\r\n| **207** | **Multi-Status** | Multiple operations have taken place and the status for each operation can be viewed in the body of the response. Typically indicates that a partial failure has occured.|\r\n\r\n## 3xx Redirection \r\n\r\n3xx codes are returned for requests that require further action.\r\n\r\n| Code | Text | Purpose |\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n| **301** | **Moved Permanently** | When the API routes have changed (unlikely), or if the incoming request is not secure (`http`), the request will be redirected to the secure (`https`) version. |\r\n| **304** | **Not Modified** | This response will be sent if the request included an `If-Modified-Since` header, but the resource has *not* been modified since the specified date.|\r\n\r\n## 4xx Client Error \r\n\r\n4xx codes are returned for requests that could not be processed due to problems with the request or the data.\r\n\r\n| Code | Text | Purpose |\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n| **400** | **Bad Request** | Issued when a malformed request was sent.\r\n| **401** | **Unauthorized** | This response is sent when your client failed to provide credentials or its credentials were invalid. |\r\n| **403** | **Forbidden** | Returned when permissions do not allow the operation. \r\n| **404** | **Not Found** | When a particular resource doesn’t exist or couldn’t be found. |\r\n| **405** | **Method Not Allowed** | The resource was found, but doesn’t support the request method. Issued when either a specific method isn’t yet implemented on a resource, or the resource doesn’t support the method at all. For example, a `PUT` on `/orders` is invalid, but a `PUT` on `/orders/{_id_}` is valid. |\r\n| **406** | **Not Acceptable** | When the client specifies a response content type in the `Accept` header that is not supported. |\r\n| **409** | **Conflict** | A change requested by the client is being rejected, due to a condition imposed by the server. The exact reasons for this response will vary from one resource to the next. An example might be attempting to delete a category whose deletion would cause products to be orphaned. Additional information about the conflict, and about how to resolve it, might be available in the response's `details` section. |\r\n| **413** | **Request Entity Too Large** | When the client requests too many objects. For example, the `limit` parameter exceeded the maximum. |\r\n| **415** | **Unsupported Media Type** | Returned due to issues with the `Content-Type` header.\r\n| **422** | **Missing or Invalid Data** | The request cannot be processed either because it omitted required fields or because it contained invalid data. See the response for more details. |\r\n| **429** | **Too Many Requests** | When an OAuth client exceeds the [rate limit](/api-docs/getting-started/basics/best-practices#best-practices_rate-limits) for API requests to a store. |\r\n\r\n## 5xx Server Error \r\n\r\n5xx codes are returned for requests that could not be processed due to an internal error with the API or server.\r\n\r\n| Code | Text | Purpose |\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n| **500** | **Internal Server Error** | When an error has occurred within the API. |\r\n| **501** | **Not Implemented** | When a request method is sent that is not supported by the API (e.g., `TRACE`, `PATCH`). |\r\n| **503** | **Service Unavailable** | When the store is “Down for Maintenance,” being upgraded to a new version, or is suspended due to administrative action or a billing issue.|\r\n| **507** | **Insufficient Storage** | When the store has reached a limitation for the resource, according to their [BigCommerce plan](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Pricing#plan-features) (e.g., 500-product limit). |\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n|Code|Common Causes|Solutions\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n|**204**, **301**, and **302**|Redirects| Try the `www` or non-`www` version of the URL.\r\n|**400**|Invalid syntax, required data missing, `content-type` header missing|Double-check request body for syntax errors and missing data; check `content-type` header.\r\n|**401** |API credentials are missing or invalid.|Double-check the `access_token` and `client_id`.\r\n|||Send cURL request with the same credentials to rule app or config issues.\r\n|**403**| App lacks required OAuth scopes, a store-owner account changed, operations resulting from API request exceed a platform limit, or URL requested is incorrect.|Double-check OAuth Scopes in **control panel** > **API Accounts** or in **Developer Portal** > **My Apps**.\r\n|||Check the URL. Are the endpoint and store hash correct?\r\n|||Ensure [platform limits](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#product-catalog-limits) have not been reached.\r\n|**415**| Request headers specify an unsupported `content-type` (or header is missing).|Double-check `content-type` request header.\r\n|**500**|Expensive API calls or an internal server error in BigCommerce.|Re-attempt the request three to five times, with increasing delays of at least a minute between attempts.\r\n|||Try reducing the number of objects being requested. You can request fewer objects in the in the v2 API, by using `?limit={count}`. In  `v2` and `v3` API, fewer objects can be requested by excluding certain fields or only requesting certain fields).\r\n||| Check the BigCommerce [Status Page](https://status.bigcommerce.com/).\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
