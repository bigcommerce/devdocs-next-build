(i.e. Some hosts would remove BC cookies because they lacked a `wp-` prefix)\n- Better error handling around 0 qty field entries on cart items. The ajax response would\n  leave the 0 in the field but would continue to show the previous price value. Entering 0\n  does not delete an item from your cart so we've updated this to return the field value to\n  its previous value.\n\n## [3.16.0]\n\n### Changed\n\n- Removed the notification to finish setting up shipping methods. So long as at least one\n  shipping zone exists (and it will always exist), the notification will not be displayed.\n- Webhooks can be toggled on or off.\n\n## [3.15.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added an option to the customizer to toggle the \"Continue Shopping\" link for an empty\n  cart between the home page and the catalog page.\n- Added a filter, `bigcommerce/cart/continue_shopping_url`, to modify the destination\n  of the \"Continue Shopping\" link for an empty cart.\n- Added additional info about routes for all connected channels to the plugin diagnostic data.\n- Added theme support for the WordPress Twenty-Twenty theme and BC4WP.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Added a new class to the product archive template title: `bc-product-archive__title`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Addressed an issue in the WP Admin with field heights on fields making them\n  not visible.\n- Fixed channel site URL to update based on the \"Site Address\" setting, not the \"WordPress Address\" setting.\n- Fixed options sorting order on select fields for admin settings sections.\n\n\n## [3.14.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added a missing entry to the 3.0.0 changelog regarding fixing the uninstaller.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- When the site url changes, the connected channel site URL is also updated.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Added a new notification in the Diagnostics panel to call out when template\n  overrides are being used.\n- Enhanced the template for product cards by adding additional classes related\n  to product statuses.\n    - bc-\\[product-id\\]\n    - bc-availability-*\n    - bc-product-sale\n    - bc-product-outofstock\n    - bc-product-lowinventory\n\n## [3.13.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added category and product view limitations to customers that are members of a\n  group with product category visibility limitations.\n- Added a filter to modify the cache time of user group category visibility.\n  `bigcommerce/product_category/group_filter_terms_user_cache_time` accepts a value,\n  in seconds, for how long to cache the local list of terms by user.\n- Added a new tab to the Resources section in the plugin admin area. The\n  new section, Tutorials, contains video tutorial links from BigCommerce's YouTube channel.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Added a feature that scrolls the browser to the top of the embedded checkout iframe\n  upon completion of the order. This resolves an issue on smaller screens where\n  the window would be stuck at the bottom of the page.\n\n## [3.12.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added the ability to sort products arbitrarily in the products shortcode. By setting\n  the `sort` parameter to `post__in`, the order of the IDs in the `id` parameter will\n  be maintained in the query results.\n- Added body classes to front end templates with product ID and availabilty, and flags for\n  sale, out of stock, and low inventory products.\n\n### Changed\n\n- The import progress bar will also appear at the top of the final onboarding screen if an\n  import is in progress.\n- Redesigned the final onboarding page to list the next steps to configure the merchant's\n  BigCommerce store. This final page will appear in the admin menu as \"Launch Steps\" until\n  all required steps have been completed.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Handled a possible exception in the product update webhook handler\n- Fixed an undefined variable in the product update webhook handler\n- Fixed the product review form handler to respect the value of the\n  `bigcommerce/product/reviews/show_form` filter that is used when\n  displaying the form.\n- Changed the default value for `bigcommerce/gift_certificates/theme` to `general`.\n  The previous value resulted in gift certificate reciepients to receive an email\n  with no gift certificate template attached.\n\n## [3.11.0]\n\n### Changed\n\n- Onboarding Screen modifications:\n  - When submitting the new account form, a loading spinner and message appear letting you know\n    we're working on creating your account.\n  - The email confirmation notice upon creating a new account is now more visible.\n  - On the Channel Selection screen, a new notice was added altering the user\n    to the alternate configuration needed for WordPress multisite setup.\n- The first channel will be automatically created when registering a new account via the WordPress plugin.\n  This store will be configured to automatically add new products to that channel. Additional channels may\n  still be created from the settings screen when multi-channel mode is enabled.\n- The item count badge on the cart menu item will be enabled when either embedded checkout or the mini-cart is enbled.\n  The item count will be included in the mini-cart ajax request and used to update the item count cookie.\n- With the release of WordPress 5.3, there were several updates to accessibility in the WP admin including\n  form fields, color contrast, and attribute updates. We've done the same with our plugin and increased\n  AA compliance throughout the plugin, including onboarding screens, settings pages, and Product UI.\n\n## [3.10.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added an option to enable the mini-cart to the nav menu onboarding screen.\n- Added support videos to onboarding screens.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed product videos to use oEmbed instead of the YouTube API, thereby supporting IE11.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Handled an inconsistency in Channels and Catalog API responses to ensure that deleted products\n  are removed from WordPress.\n- Removed erroneous override of product shortcode/block sorting when a sorting argument is explicitly given.\n- Updated BigCommerce API client to version 2.0.3 to handle product option sort order.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Product gallery template overrides based off of the short-lived 3.9.0 template should continue to function,\n  but should be updated for compatibility with future versions. Templates depending on the YouTube API are deprecated.\n\n## [3.9.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added the retail price to the product price template. The retail price will only display\n  when it is set on the product in the BigCommerce admin.\n- Added support for product videos in the product gallery section. The videos will always be YouTube\n  videos. We've implemented the YouTube Player API to assist with play and pause features when\n  switching between multiple videos.\n    - There is a known issue with this YT Player API on IE 11 and videos are currently not playing\n      in that browser. This will be addressed in the next release.\n\n### Changed\n\n- `DELETE` requests to the WP REST API are now camouflaged as `POST` requests to work around\n  web hosts that do not allow standard HTTP methods.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the missing \"Cart\" section in the theme customizer when visiting the customizer before\n  first saving any settings in the plugin admin.\n\n## [3.8.1]\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated embedded checkout SDK to version 1.37.1 to better handle failures from the cart handover.\n\n## [3.8.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Created a mini-cart template. There are two ways to display the mini-cart. (1) Use a\n  widget to display the mini-cart in a registered sidebar area. (2) Activate the toggle\n  in the theme customizer to display the mini-cart when the cart nav menu icon is clicked.\n  The contents of the mini-cart will be loaded asynchronously to avoid deleterious effects\n  on page caching plugins. The mini-cart has its own set of templates that can be customized\n  independently of the full cart templates.\n- Added two more WooCommerce function stubs for compatibility with some themes:\n  `wc_get_cart_url()` and `wc_get_checkout_url()`. Each will point to the corresponding\n  BigCommerce page for cart or checkout. Props to @mark-netalico.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Removed an erroneous error message that displayed when updating from version 3.5 or earlier.\n  If the site's currency matches the store's default currency, no error message should display\n  that says the currency is disabled.\n\n### Changed\n\n- If a product variant has an image, and that variant is purchased, the order history\n  page will display that variant's image instead of the default product image.\n- Clarified 3.6.0 changelog entry regarding assignment of currencies to channels.\n\n## [3.7.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- When using the WordPress password reset form or updated a user's password from the\n  WordPress admin, the new password will be synchronized with the BigCommerce customer\n  account for users who's accounts are configured to sync with BigCommerce.\n- Added an endpoint to handle abandoned cart recovery. Visitors who abandon their\n  carts will receive an email with a link that includes a token to recover the cart.\n  On clicking the link, the cart will be restored in the user's new browser session.\n- Added new route configurations to point BigCommerce-generated links to pages on the\n  WordPress site:\n  - `create_account` points to the user registration page\n  - `forgot_password` points to the lost password page\n  - `account_order_status` points to the order history page\n  - `account_new_return` points to the shipping & returns page\n  - `recover_abandoned_cart` points to the cart recovery endpoint\n\n### Changed\n\n- If a user account is configured to sync with BigCommerce but the customer ID user\n  meta is missing (as may happen if the BigCommerce plugin has been uninstalled and\n  reinstalled), a matching customer account may be found by email and used for\n  password validation.\n\n## [3.6.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Added currency selection to the settings screen. Any currencies enabled in the\n  BigCommerce admin are available to assign as the currency for the WordPress site.\n  When in multi-channel mode, a different currency can be assigned to each channel.\n- Added support for custom SEO titles and descriptions. The SEO title set in the\n  BigCommerce admin will override the HTML title tag for the product single. The\n  SEO description set in the BigCommerce admin will be used to render a meta\n  description tag in the page header. Note: If using Yoast SEO, custom descriptions\n  set in the Yoast meta box will lead to a duplicate meta tag. To remove the tag\n  from this plugin, add the following snipped to a theme or plugin:\n  ```\n  add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function() {\n  \tremove_action( 'wp_head', bigcommerce()->post_types->product_page_meta_description, 0 );\n  }, 100, 0 );\n  ```\n- Added support for custom image alt text. The alt text set in the BigCommerce admin will\n  be imported into WordPress, where WordPress's standard image rendering functions will\n  use it as the value for the `alt` attribute.\n- Added a new global JS function to the `bigcommerce_config` global JS object. You can now\n  retrieve the current user's cart ID via JS using `bigcommerce_config.cart.getCartID();`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed several locations where \"bigcommerce\" was misspelled as \"bigcomerce\" in\n  text domains, HTML classes, and filter names.\n\n### Changed\n\n- On uninstall of the plugin, pages related to the plugin will have \"-uninstalled\"\n  appended to their slugs when they are set to draft. If the plugin is reinstalled\n  later and these pages still exist, they will be republished and \"-uninstalled\"\n  will be removed from the slugs.\n- If a product variant has an image, and that variant is added to the cart, the\n  cart page will display that variant's image instead of the default product image.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Currency formatting settings have been removed. Formatting settings are pulled\n  from the BigCommerce currencies API. PHP's intl extension will still be used\n  for formatting if it is available.\n\n## [3.5.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Product pick lists will include a \"None\" option if that modifier field\n  is not required.\n- Added filters to modify the price range and calculated price range of\n  a product. `bigcommerce/product/price_range/data` affects the data\n  that feeds both. The formatted output can be modified with the filters\n  `bigcommerce/product/price_range/formatted` and\n  `bigcommerce/product/calculated_price_range/formatted`\n- Added hooks to the initialization of the product importer. Use\n  `bigcommerce/import/task_list` to modify the list of tasks for the import.\n  Use `bigcommerce/import/task_manager/init` to perform additional setup\n  actions on the task manager (e.g., register more tasks).\n- Added a control to the theme customizer to toggle display of product\n  inventory. Inventory can be shown for all products that track inventory,\n  or only for products with low inventory. Inventory display is filterable\n  per product using the hook `bigcommerce/product/inventory/should_display`.\n- Added a webhook to listen for completed checkouts. The webhook will trigger\n  the action `bigcommerce/webhooks/checkout_complete`.\n- Added support for a omitting products from initial Pricing API calls if they have\n  a `.preinitialized` class added to the pricing DOM node. This will allow 3rd\n  party plugins/themes to add this CSS class based on their needs/conditions.\n- Added a toggle in the theme customizer to control display of default\n  pricing while waiting for Pricing API responses.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the destination URLs for webhooks, which were missing a path component.\n- Fixed display of error messaging when attempting to log in with an\n  invalid user name.\n- When running in multi-channel mode, removing a product from one channel\n  could remove its images that were shared with the same product in another\n  channel. The images will now stay in place and have their parent post\n  adjusted to the surviving product.\n\n### Changed\n\n- The template `components/products/product-price.php` has two new variables\n  available: `$price_range` and `$calculated_price_range`. This allows\n  filtering of those values beyond what was previously possible. Existing\n  templates will continue to work with values pulled from the product\n  on render.\n- The template `components/products/product-price.php` has a new variable,\n  `$visible`, to use in place of the `bc-product__pricing--visible` class.\n  This controls whether default pricing can be displayed.\n- Default sorting of the Product post type archive and taxonomy archives\n  has been changed from \"Title A-Z\" to \"Featured\". This can be changed using\n  the `bigcommerce/query/default_sort` filter.\n- \"Featured\" sorting now considers the Product's sort order, as set in the\n  BigCommerce admin. Featured items will appear first, followed by all other\n  items sorted by sort order. If the sort order for a product is not set,\n  it is treated as a `10`.\n- The template `components/products/inventory-level.php` has two new variables\n  available: `$status` and `$label`. This simplifies the template, while\n  enabling additional filtering of the values. Existing templates overrides\n  will continue to work with values pulled from the product on render.\n- If embedded checkout is disabled, the current customer's cart count\n  will not display on the cart menu item. The behavior is filterable with\n  the `bigcommerce/cart/menu/show_count` hook.\n- Pricing API requests for unauthenticated users will use `null` as the\n  customer group ID, which uses the default guest group, instead of `0`,\n  which uses no group.\n- When selecting options and modifiers for a product, we're no longer debouncing\n  the clicks and then disabling the fields while a Pricing API call is made.\n  Fields remain enabled, and changes will cause previous Pricing API\n  calls that might be pending to abort.\n\n## Deprecated\n\n- The unused constants `\\BigCommerce\\Cart\\Add_To_Cart::CART_COOKIE` and\n  `\\BigCommerce\\Cart\\Add_To_Cart::COUNT_COOKIE` are deprecated and will\n  be removed in a future version.\n\n### Removed\n\n- The filter `bigcommerce/template/product/archive/default_sort` has been removed.\n  Use `bigcommerce/query/default_sort` instead.\n\n## [3.4.1]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- The Pricing API request cache did not properly differentiate based on\n  request parameters, sometimes leading to incorrect prices displaying.\n\n## [3.4.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- Created a filter, `bigcommerce/api/ttl`, to control the TTL of the API\n  response cache. Caches now default to one hour, but can be overridden\n  per request. Requests to the pricing API no longer force a cache flush.\n- Added support for sort order on product modifiers. The order will be imported\n  from BigCommerce and respected when rendering the product form.\n- Added a step to the import process to delete categories and brands that\n  were deleted in BigCommerce. This also resolves the issue of a re-created\n  category getting a numeric suffix on the slug when the new term is created.\n- **Wish Lists**\n  - BigCommerce Wish Lists are now part of user accounts.\n  - You can create, edit and delete a Wish List as well as add and remove items.\n  - You and make your list public or private. Private lists cannot be shared\n    and can only be seen by the list owner.\n  - Shared Wish Lists are presented as a filtered version of the main product\n    archive.\n  - Deleting a Wish List cannot be undone. You will be given a confirmation\n    screen before deleting.\n  - Wish Lists are currently product ID based and not quantity based.\n    Attempting to add the same product to your list will not increase the\n    quantity nor will it duplicate the product in your list. Only one instance\n    of a product variant is allowed in a Wish List.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Product categories and brands will now derive their slugs from the\n  \"Custom URL\" property set in the BigCommerce admin. If a category name\n  changes, the WordPress term slug will update to reflect the new name.\n- Gutenberg blocks were not able to utilize the drag-and-drop feature\n  due to a conflict with a JS library. This lib has been upgraded and\n  drag-and-drop functionality has been restored.\n- Products options and modifiers that contained only a single option would\n  cause the Cart/Buy button to be disabled permanently. This has been been\n  fixed.\n- The user meta key `bigcommerce_nav_settings_initialized` was not correctly\n  removed when running the plugin uninstaller. This has been fixed.\n- Removed the product condition from cart and order history when the product\n  is not configured to display its condition.\n- Disabled WordPress's kses filters when storing data in the import queue.\n  This fixes mangled HTML in some circumstances. Post content is still filtered\n  later in the import.\n- Upgraded Lodash JS library dependency to the latest version.\n\n### Changed\n- Refinery template (`components/catalog/refinery.php`) has removed the\n  wrapper element in favor of the Controller variables. Update your template\n  as needed.\n- The Gutenberg Product Component Block now has admin previews that contain\n  rendered HTML product content for all component types. When a product ID\n  is not found or is no longer valid, a default message will display letting\n  you know the product is unavailable on the admin side and the theme side.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- API factory methods for building widget-related clients are deprecated.\n  Calls to `Api_Factory::placement()`, `Api_Factory::themeRegions()`, and\n  `Api_Factory::widgetTemplate()` should be replaced with `Api_Factory::widget()`.\n  These methods will be removed in a future version.\n\n## [3.3.0]\n\n### Changed\n- HTML elements can now be used in all text string filters so long as it\n  passes the same `wp_kses` rules used on comments. Previously, HTML inserted\n  via filters for text strings was omitted in certain cases.\n  For instance, on the ajax add to cart message.\n\n\n## [3.2.0]\n\n### Added\n- Display variant images in the product gallery. Once a specific variant\n  is selected, its image will be used as the primary gallery image.\n- Added stack traces to the error log when exceptions are thrown during\n  the import process\n- Added a screen at the end of the onboarding process to guide merchants\n  to their next steps.\n- Added support for pre-order and non-purchaseable product availability\n  settings. Includes two new theme customizer fields to control the text\n  for the \"Add to Cart\"/\"Buy Now\" buttons when displaying pre-order products.\n- Added support for products with hidden prices. They will use the new\n  template `components/products/product-hidden-price.php` to not show the price.\n- Added a new option for the Product Components block/shortcode for Add To Cart.\n  This will output the Add to Cart/Buy Now button and form on any page, including\n  variants if applicable. Example Usage: `[bc-component id=\"431\" type=\"add_to_cart\"]`\n- Added a new Channel Select field in the product picker UI in the WP Admin. You can\n  now search for products from any channel you've connected to your WP Store. Selecting\n  a channel will initiate a new query immediately and subsequently only produce product\n  search results from that channel.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed import of product descriptions containing HTML links. WordPress\n  core was adding `noopener` attributes prematurely, breaking the JSON\n  data stored in the queue.\n- Fixed a fatal error when updating to version 3.0+ from 2.2.1 or earlier\n  while a product import is in progress.\n\n### Changed\n- Pass through custom error messages from the API when Add to Cart fails.\n  Previously we were returning `null` and using a generic message. We're still\n  using the generic message but only when a more specific message is not\n  available from the API.\n- The template `components/products/product-gallery.php` has changed to\n  accommodate variant images.\n- The template `components/products/product-form.php` has a new variable\n  `$message` containing the pre-order message to display for the product.\n- The `bigcommerce/customer/group_id` filter will be called from\n  `\\BigCommerce\\Accounts\\Customer::get_group_id()`, even when the current\n  user is logged out or does not have a customer ID.\n\n## [3.1.0]\n\n### Added\n- Added a button to reset channel listing overrides, enabling editors to\n  reconnect a product to the base product for future updates.\n- Added a button to immediately re-sync a product. Editors can import the\n  latest changes from the BigCommerce API for that product without running\n  a full import on the entire catalog.\n- Added a missing entry to the 3.0.0 changelog regarding fixing the uninstaller.\n- Added a method to fetch customer group info. `$customer->get_group()->get_info()`\n- Created an option to toggle synchronization of analytics settings.\n- Added a customizer option to disable Quick View on product cards. When disabled,\n  product card images are wrapped in a link to the product single.\n- Added a template for the sku component of a product, `components/products/product-sku.php`.\n- Added a new shortcode/block that allows selection of distinct product\n  components. Example usage: `[bc-component type=\"description\" id=\"117\"]`.\n  Valid types are: sku, description, image, title.\n- Added an option to disable sync of analytics IDs.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed missing markup for AMP templates. Some valid tags had been\n  erroneously stripped out.\n\n### Changed\n- Added a new parameter to the product title template (`components/products/product-title.php`)\n  to set the header level. It should set the header appropriately\n  for the context in which the component is loaded (h1 for the product\n  single, h2 for the shortcode/block single, and h3 for the product card).\n- Moved the Quick View markup from `components/products/product-card.php` to\n  a new template, `components/products/quick-view-image.php`.\n- Removed the wrapper div from the template `components/products/product-quick-view.php`.\n  The wrapper will be added by the template controller.\n- Changed the `assign_terms` capability for categories and brands to `do_not_allow`.\n  Assignments would be overwritten by the next import. This keeps it from\n  happening in the first place to avoid confusion.\n- Turned off the `autocomplete` attribute on API fields in the settings\n  page. This will help to avoid an issue where autocomplete causes a change to\n  user credentials and causes the store to disconnect when settings are saved.\n- Updated the product quick view template, `components/products/product-quick-view.php`,\n  uses the new product sku component.\n- Updated the product shortcode single template, `components/products/product-shortcode-single.php`,\n  uses the new product sku component.\n- Updated the product single template, `components/products/product-single.php`,\n  uses the new product sku component.\n- Updated the onboarding flow to indicate where the user is in the setup process. Additionally,\n  some styles were updated on the content areas, buttons, and start-over feature.\n- Optimized the import process to avoid fetching data for products not listed\n  in any active channels.\n\n### Deprecated\n- Deprecated the `$quickview` and `$attributes` variables in the template\n  `components/products/product-card.php`. The variables are now empty, and\n  will be removed in a future version.\n\n## [3.0.2]\n\n### Fixed\n- Updated API client library to 1.12.1 to fix error in class definition\n  for PriceRecord.\n\n## [3.0.1]\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed duplicate posts created in WordPress when importing products\n  in draft or pending status.\n\n## [3.0.0]\n\n### Added\n- Added support for connecting to multiple BigCommerce channels. Since the\n  plugin can't know the particular use case a store has for using multiple\n  channels, we provide the base framework for site developers to extend\n  in a way that makes sense for their business. Multi-channel support\n  requires opt-in using a filter:\n  ```\n  add_filter( 'bigcommerce/channels/enable-multi-channel', '__return_true' );\n  ```\n  This will enable an admin to connect to multiple channels on the settings\n  screen. The primary channel will still be used for all front-end requests\n  unless filtered to use a different channel. Example:\n  ```\n  add_filter( 'bigcommerce/channel/current', function( $channel ) {\n    // do some logic here to determine what channel to use\n    return get_term( 697, \\BigCommerce\\Taxonomies\\Channel\\Channel::NAME );\n  });\n  ```\n- Created a taxonomy for storing channels. Most stores will only have one,\n  but a store with multi-channel enabled may have many. The taxonomy's UI\n  is hidden, and it is only exposed during onboarding (when selecting the\n  initial channel) and in the Channel Settings section when multi-channel\n  is enabled. All products are associated with a channel term on import.\n\n### Changed\n- Updated the position and design of the start-over button and confirmation\n  message for the on-boarding process.\n- Fixed display of tax and total price in order history when an order was\n  paid for entirely with store credit. It should no longer show a negative\n  subtotal, and the grand total should properly display as $0.00 (formatted\n  appropriately for the local currency).\n- Currency can now be filtered at any point in the request. Previously,\n  the currency would be locked in place when creating the formatter\n  in the Currency service provider. The service provider will now use\n  a factory method to return a formatter based on the current, possibly\n  filtered, value of the `\\BigCommerce\\Settings\\Sections\\Currency::CURRENCY_CODE`\n  option. Use the `pre_option_bigcommerce_currency_code` filter to adjust\n  the currency in use at any given point in the request.\n- The import process has changed to more efficiently support imports when\n  connected to multiple channels. After fetching listings for each channel,\n  products will be fetched from the Catalog API _once_. When fetching products\n  in bulk, we now also fetch options and modifiers, taking advantage of\n  new capabilities of the API. This limits the bulk import to 10 products\n  per request, but saves two additional queries per product later in the import.\n  The tasks to fetch listings and initialize channels now have a suffix\n  of the channel ID on the string used to trigger the task status.\n- The import queue is now stored as hidden posts in the `wp_posts` table,\n  using the post type `bigcommerce_task`.\n- Method signature for the `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Products\\Product_Builder`\n  constructor has changed. It now expects a \\WP_Term representing the channel\n  the product belongs to.\n- Method signature for the `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Products\\Product_Importer`\n  constructor has changed. It now expects a \\WP_Term representing the channel\n  the product belongs to instead of a channel ID and an instance of the Channels API.\n- Method signature for the `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Products\\Product_Saver`\n  constructor has changed. It now expects a \\WP_Term representing the channel\n  the product belongs to.\n- The order of operations in `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Products\\Product_Saver`\n  has changed to assign terms to a product before setting its post data\n  or post meta. This is to support multiple products with the same slug\n  but in different channels.\n- Method signature for the `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Products\\Product_Strategy_Factory`\n  constructor has changed. It now expects a \\WP_Term representing the channel\n  the product belongs to.\n- Product price ranges are now calculated on import and stored in post meta\n  rather than relying on values from the bc_variants table on render.\n- Moved `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Review_Builder` to\n  `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Reviews\\Review_Builder`.\n- Moved `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Review_Fetcher` to\n  `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Importers\\Reviews\\Review_Fetcher`.\n- Method signature for the `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Processors\\Channel_Initializer`\n  constructor has changed. It now expects a \\WP_Term representing the channel\n  to initialize.\n- Renamed `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Processors\\Listing_ID_Fetcher` to\n  `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Processors\\Listing_Fetcher` and changed its constructor\n  signature to require a \\WP_Term representing the channel for the listings.\n- Renamed `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Processors\\Product_ID_Fetcher` to\n  `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Processors\\Product_Data_Fetcher`.\n- Changed the method signature for the `\\BigCommerce\\Import\\Processors\\Queue_Runner`\n  constructor. It no longer requires an instance of the Channels API.\n- Moved `\\BigCommerce\\Merchant\\Routes` to `\\BigCommerce\\Taxonomies\\Channels\\Routes`\n\n### Fixed\n- Updated registration of block editor plugins to work with recent\n  versions of Gutenberg.\n- Fixed fatal error in the uninstaller from an undefined class constant.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed the `bc_products` table. All queries that used this table have been\n  updated to use post meta.\n- Removed the `bc_variants` table. All queries that used this table have been\n  updated to use post meta.\n- Removed the `bc_import_queue` table. All import tasks have been moved to\n  the `wp_posts` table.\n- Removed the `bigcommerce/pricing/channel_id` filter. The pricing API request\n  will now derive the value from the current channel.\n- Removed the `bigcommerce/pricing/currency_code` filter. The pricing API\n  request will now derive the value from the `bigcommerce_currency_code` option.\n\n### Deprecated\n- The `post_id` field in the `bc_reviews` table is no longer used and\n  will be removed in a future release.\n\n## [2.2.1]\n\n### Changed\n- Updated the way cached pricing works while requesting new data from the\n  Pricing API. We're now displaying the cached pricing first. We've also\n  removed the spinner while loading pricing data and replaced with a simple\n  fade in/out of prices.\n\n## [2.2.0]\n\n### Added\n- Added a redirect to the Welcome/Settings screen on plugin activation\n\n### Changed\n- Updated the BigCommerce Checkout SDK to version 1.18.10\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a layout issue on the WP Admin BigCommerce Resources page where\n  resource cards were misaligned.\n- Fixed AMP validation errors from improperly included scripts. Thanks, @westonruter!\n\n\n## [2.1.0]\n\n### Added\n- Uses the new BigCommerce pricing API to retrieve more accurate pricing\n  data based on selected product variants, options, and customer groups.\n  The original price display feature still exists and is now the fallback\n  if unable to fetch live pricing.\n- Added a setting to determine whether prices should display with tax\n  included or excluded. This duplicates a setting from the BigCommerce\n  admin that is not available via the Store API.\n- Added the `customer_group_id` property to the customer profile object\n  retrieved from the Customer API.\n- Added a routine to make BigCommerce nav menu meta boxes visible to users\n  by default.\n- Added webhooks to listen for product inventory updates. A received webhook\n  will schedule an immediate cron job to pull updated product data from\n  the Catalog API.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgraded Checkout SDK to version 1.18.5\n- Reduced the prominence of the checkout requirements notification when on\n  admin pages unrelated to the BigCommerce plugin.\n- Updated the template `components/products/product-price.php` with markup\n  to support Pricing API ajax requests.\n\n## [2.0.1]\n\n### Fixed\n- Handled the new firing order of block-editor related hooks in transitioning\n  from the Gutenberg plugin to WordPress 5.0+. This fixes a PHP warning\n  and some odd behavior from other plugins that register meta areas\n  for the block editor.\n\n\n## [2.0.0]\n\n### Added\n- Added new links and buttons to the Products custom post type edit screen\n  and the BigCommerce Settings page for managing your products on BigCommerce\n  and logging in to your account\n- Added a Resources page to the BigCommerce admin section. The Resources page\n  contains tab separated content that provides users with a repository of\n  themes, plugins, apps, and support links to enhance or extend their\n  BigCommerce for WordPress installation.\n- Added an option to create a new menu in addition to selecting a preexisting\n  menu on the Menu Select screen during on-boarding.\n- Added an option to configure channel settings for new products during\n  on-boarding.

Filters `bigcommerce/template/wrapper/tag`,\n  `bigcommerce/template/wrapper/classes`, and `bigcommerce/template/wrapper/attributes`\n  are available to modify this wrapper. Modification may break JavaScript\n  provided by the plugin.
